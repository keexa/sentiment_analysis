Our strategic priorities 
Our strategy has been developed to drive sustainable growth through three priorities: 
1. Continuing to invest in a strong UK business 
2. Establishing multichannel leadership in all of our markets 
3. Pursuing disciplined international growth 
   
Chairman’s statement 
 
Sir Richard Broadbent 
Chairman 
“Being a leading retailer today is not a guarantee of value creation tomorrow. We need to ensure that we are tomorrow’s leading retailer.” 
Continuity and change 
This has been an important year for Tesco. There has been a great deal to occupy us in relation to current trading as weak markets and intense competition persist. At the same time, we continue to reshape the business to address the fundamental changes taking place in the retail market. 
The challenging trading conditions of the past year have impacted profits and necessarily remain a focus of management attention. We continue to devote a lot of energy and creativity to creating products and services which customers want to buy at prices they find attractive, through whichever channel they choose and which leave them wanting to visit us again. We have continued to focus on improving the experience for customers with continued investment in colleagues, a big programme of store refurbishment, significant investment in quality and a renewal of product ranges, including the entire finest* range, and a continued emphasis on Building a Better Tesco in the widest sense of the term. 
More broadly, however, it has been a year when your company has moved from addressing existing business issues to driving our strategy for future growth and value. There is never a year in which a business focuses solely on one or the other. But it is fair to say that at some point in the past year the balance of where our energies and resources are focused tipped from addressing past issues to investing in the future. We remain focused on the present but we are starting to quicken our pace into the future. 
The future: strategic developments in retail The backdrop of technology-driven change in the retail sector becomes a more insistent drumbeat every day. Boundaries between the online and offline world are becoming blurred. The challenge, and opportunity, for retailers is not just to have (and be able to operate across) multiple channels. It is to meet the rapid changes in consumer behaviour that we are seeing as technology opens up new horizons for them. The capacity for consumers to communicate instantly with each other, with us and with other retailers is driving completely different expectations for service levels, choice, convenience, indeed the whole shopping experience. A level of customisation and personalisation, unthinkable a decade ago is becoming the norm. 
Consequently, being a leading retailer today is not a guarantee of value creation tomorrow. We need to ensure that we are tomorrow’s leading retailer. We had already set ourselves on the path to becoming a leading multichannel retailer to meet this challenge. The accelerating evolution of customer behaviours reinforces us in this choice of direction and has led us in the past year progressively to intensify our actions to deliver this end. This includes not only ensuring a more seamless service for customers but also a business which matches more closely what they want, for example by making our larger stores more compelling destinations in their own right as well as ensuring we offer more convenience stores. 
Strategic change requires investment. Our task is to allocate resources to compete effectively in today’s market while giving priority to ensuring that we emerge as winners in the coming multichannel, customer-centric market. Your Board is extremely focused on the need to manage this balance between current and future returns with great care, optimising both without imperilling either. The business is taking decisive steps to free up capital and operational resources, but for the time being the imperative of securing the longer-term future means that our current financial performance remains constrained. 
Other business priorities 
In my foreword last year, I said: 
“Our strategic choices are defined by three parameters: the strength of the Tesco brand; the internet and all the associated developments it is driving; and the potential to leverage our skill and scale internationally...” 
I have remarked on the fundamental re-orientation of the business to meet the changes being driven by the internet. Let me say a word about brand; and about how we view our international businesses.

Chairman’s statement continued The Tesco brand 
through levels of transparency and disclosure which are undoubtedly now world-leading. 
We were pleased to welcome Mark Armour to the Board in September last year and the expertise, rooted in a long business career, that he brings to our discussions. 
We announced on 4 April that Laurie McIlwee had resigned from his position as Chief Financial Officer. I would like to thank Laurie for his contribution to Tesco over the last 14 years. Together with Philip and the wider team, Laurie has played an important role in our process to transform Tesco and position it to be a winner in the new era of retailing. I and the Board wish him every success for the future. 
Financial results 
Our task is to deliver value to our shareholders and we hold this goal in mind in all our deliberations. The trade-offs at the present time are not straightforward and we continually track the balance between future value and current return, seeking to ensure an optimum balance between the two in the context of the rapid changes which the retail sector is experiencing. This is reflected in a number of one-off write-offs associated with significant business or market developments and in our results generally which have again been held back by the factors I have described. Revenues from continuing operations were broadly flat and underlying profit fell by (6.9)%. We understand the importance of the dividend to our shareholders and our confidence in the strategic choices we are making is reflected in an unchanged dividend. 
Conclusion 
In pursuing our goals, the most important resource we have is our colleagues who are the ones who work unfailingly to anticipate and meet the needs of customers, and I and the whole Board are grateful to each and every one of them for all that they do. 
The future is a retail world where retailers will need to operate across multiple channels while meeting wholly different customer expectations for service levels, choice, convenience and overall experience. You may be assured that we will compete hard in the current market but the bigger prize we seek on your behalf is to utilise 
the unique assets and resources of Tesco to ensure we emerge as leaders in the future world of retailing. 
Sir Richard Broadbent 
Chairman 
“The future is a retail world where retailers will need to operate across multiple channels while meeting wholly different customer expectations for service levels, choice, convenience and overall experience.” 
Re-building the Tesco brand to become synonymous again with value, choice and quality, to be seen again as unerringly on the customers’ side, is central to our future. In the multichannel world we are moving into, what you are known for will be 
as important as the channels through which you sell. We have and will continue therefore the patient work to strengthen trust in our brand. This is not without its cost but we believe it is as important an investment as any other part of our strategy. 
Values are central to any brand and last year we took the major step of introducing a new Value: we use our scale for good. This is evidently a long-term project but the year has seen the first steps taken to embed this sentiment as a touchstone of the business. These are reported in more detail in our separate update of “Tesco and Society” which is being published alongside this report. 
International 
Our priority is to deliver value to our shareholders. The last two years or so have seen us address tough decisions in relation to the international business. That said, we continue to see opportunity to create value internationally by leveraging our skills and scale in relatively rapidly growing economies with less developed modern retail sectors where the rate of economic growth coupled with switching to modern retail outlets can generate attractive returns. 
Such opportunities need to be taken with focus, flexibility and care. The completion in the past year of our exit from the US underpins the importance of piloting new ventures; of being open to partnership especially in new markets; to selecting rigorously those markets that meet tightly-drawn criteria for investment; and to ensure close management and control of the investments. Many of our choices this year, to enter partnerships in China and India or to invest modestly in an internet start-up in South East Asia, reflect this philosophy of establishing a position of opportunity and testing returns against our criteria as a basis for building long-term, value-enhancing positions. 
Governance 
In common with other public companies, we are meeting this year new standards of disclosure. Our Remuneration Policy is set out on pages 41 to 61 for shareholders to consider. Our accounts 
as a whole have been considered by the Board in the light of the new test to be “fair, balanced and understandable.” We have taken seriously the spirit as well as the letter of the new Regulations, which are seeking to build trust between the corporate sector and society generally 
 
02 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Report from the Chief Executive 
 
Philip Clarke 
Chief Executive 
Introduction 
This year marks my 40th year at Tesco. I have found every single one of those years exciting and challenging, but I have never seen such a pace of change within the industry as I have over the past year, driven by both structural and cyclical forces. 
Consumer behaviours are changing more quickly than ever before and that means we have to accelerate our rate of change too. Customers are increasingly using technology in all aspects of their everyday lives and the pace of transition to online shopping has been even faster than we expected. Since taking over 
as Chief Executive of your business in 2011, I have been clear of the need to transform Tesco to be a leader in the multichannel retail environment. The way the market has developed since then has underlined the importance of this strategic choice. 
At the same time, consumer behaviours continue to be strongly influenced by economic conditions which have continued to be tough in the markets in which we operate. Overall, consumers are spending more carefully. They are increasingly choosing to shop online or in smaller convenience stores rather than in large stores, which presents a particular challenge for Tesco given the number of large stores we have around the world. 
So we face a mix of Tesco-specific issues and broader issues affecting the whole sector and it is important that we tackle both. This is a large agenda and has kept us fully occupied over the past year. 
Thanks to the foresight of my predecessors, over the course of more than 17 years, we’ve already developed strong online and convenience businesses. This has ensured we are well-positioned to address the industry-wide changes we are 
experiencing and we have focused our resources on building on these strengths. 
Two years ago, I also outlined plans to deal with the more Tesco-specific issues by improving our offer for customers in the UK through a programme of investment in improved service, quality and price. It was important that we started when we did, and this programme of improvement continues and is being accelerated as competitive conditions intensify. With our strategy already in place, we know what we need to do, and we know that we have to do it even more quickly. 
These issues do mean that our headline numbers are not where we want or planned for them to be. We have taken decisive action to improve performance, but the issues we face cannot all be fixed overnight. We need to do more, we need to go faster. I am, however, confident that we have the right strategies and the right team to compete effectively in the current market and to ensure that we emerge a leader in the multichannel world of retailing. 
Progress in 2013/14 
We laid out our three strategic priorities for the business in April 2013: 
1. Continuing to invest in a strong UK business 2. Establishing multichannel leadership in all 
of our markets 3. Pursuing disciplined international growth 
These priorities are even more relevant today than they were when I announced them and we have made progress on each of them. 
1. Continuing to invest in a strong UK business We launched the Building a Better Tesco plan in the UK two years ago and invested £1 billion in six key areas of the business: Service & Staff, Stores & Formats, Range & Quality, Price & Value, Brand & Marketing and Clicks & Bricks. As I made clear at the time, we had been running our stores ‘too hot’ for too long and this investment was long-overdue. I have described below some of the progress we have made under each of the areas of the plan. 
(i) Service & Staff 
Having taken on 8,000 more colleagues in our stores, this year we’ve focused on providing further customer service training. We have delivered training to more than 250,000 colleagues in the UK, helping them to make every moment with customers matter. We have rescheduled 300,000 hours in the last year with the aim of having the right number of colleagues in our stores, in the right departments and at times of the day that customers need them most. 
We are seeing improvements in customer perceptions and the proportion of customers 

Our strategic priorities 
Our strategy has been developed to drive sustainable growth through three priorities: 
1. Continuing to invest in a strong UK business 
2. Establishing multichannel leadership in all of our markets 
3. Pursuing disciplined international growth 
Further discussion around each of these priorities is provided within my report on the following pages.

Report from the Chief Executive continued 
This year, we completed the work to materially improve our 8,000 core Tesco products. 
rating customer service and staff helpfulness as excellent has improved by 40% since 2012. We know we need to do more in order to make service a point of difference for us and to deliver excellent customer service for every customer on every shopping trip. This will remain a key priority for the UK business in the coming year. 
(ii) Stores & Formats 
Over the last two years, we have refreshed over a third of our UK stores in some way. This work has involved improvements to store environments and has prioritised the departments that matter most to customers, primarily fresh food. We have applied the learnings from each phase of the refresh programme to the next, enhancing our approach as the programme has evolved. As a result, there are some newer initiatives that we will seek to introduce to some of 
the stores that formed the early part of the refresh programme. 
Following the trial stores we completed in 2012/13, our refresh programme to date has been more focused on our Express format and on our smaller Superstores. Given the change in shopping behaviours I mentioned above, our larger stores have been a drag 
on performance and this is one of the most important areas that we need to address. Therefore, the focus of our refresh programme will now be on reinventing our largest stores to ensure that they are worth the trip for customers. 
This year we have tested a number of ingredients for our Extra refresh programme, and begun to roll out a range of components to help make these stores relevant destinations that customers actively choose to visit. In 2014/15 we will refresh 110 of our Extra stores, aiming to make them even stronger destinations. More of the ingredients will appear in these larger stores and typically they will feature strong clothing and general merchandise as well as tailored new food experiences, such as Giraffe, Euphorium, Harris+Hoole and Decks dependent upon the local customer. We will also be working hard to put ‘Food First’ and create the best ranges of fresh foods. We are looking forward to accelerating the appearance of these new features in our stores over the next three years. While this refresh work causes some short-term disruption, the resulting uplifts will be long-lasting. 
(iii) Range & Quality 
This year, we completed the work to materially improve our 8,000 core Tesco products. Following the relaunch of our finest* range in October, we relaunched our Healthy Living range in January. The customer response to the improvements we have made across our Tesco products has been pleasing, and our own-label sales account for around half of our total UK sales (excluding petrol). 
Whilst the direct impact of the meat contamination issue last year was limited to just four of our products, we have made marked improvements in the supply chain, shortening its length and focusing on provenance, greater control and traceability. Through our world-class testing programme, we have tested over 5,300 products and we are the first major retailer to offer two-year direct contracts for beef and lamb farmers right back to the farm gate. More than 300 farmers have signed up already. 
(iv) Price & Value 
Customers are actively seeking the best value, and this is more important than ever in a market which has become even more competitive over recent months. It is essential that customers can trust our prices. We want prices to be stable, we want them to be logical and, of course, we want them to be competitive. Our Price Promise has now been in place for over a year and provides instant reassurance to customers that on fresh foods, on own-label and on branded products they will not lose out 
at Tesco. 
Every customer perception measure on price has improved over the last 12 months, but there is still more to do on pricing. We know how important it is to customers that they get the best possible prices on lines that matter most to them. That is why in February, we announced that we are accelerating the pace of change including an initial investment of £200 million in bringing down, and keeping down, prices of key lines, starting with milk, carrots, onions and eggs. You can be sure that we will continue to focus relentlessly on ensuring we are competitive in the marketplace and where we need to do more, we will do more. 
(v) Brand & Marketing 
Clubcard is more important now than it has ever been before. It is at the core of providing a differentiated, personalised offer and it allows customers to choose how to unlock greater value for themselves. It is at the heart of our unique relationship with our customers and we need to use the power of Clubcard to personalise how we communicate with and serve our customers, providing them with offers and services which are relevant and tailored to how they live their lives. We are using Clubcard to deliver more value for customers and have delivered almost 60 million personalised mailings this year for products that customers buy week in, week out. 
A good example of the power of Clubcard and of the advocacy that it can drive is the launch of Clubcard Fuel Save. It is a completely new concept for the UK retail industry. Customers can earn money off their fuel, just by doing their normal shopping. It is inclusive – every penny counts towards the level of saving whether customers are shopping online for their

weekly shop or popping in store for a sandwich, and they are in control of when they redeem their saving too. In just the first few weeks, more than three million customers saved money on fuel. 
Clubcard Fuel Save is one example of the things we are doing to improve loyalty. Loyalty has always been important to Tesco because greater loyalty delivers greater lifetime value. 
(vi) Clicks & Bricks 
As I have already referenced, the pace of the transition to online is rapid. This creates challenges for the industry but we have a market-leading, profitable grocery home shopping business that already generates £2.5 billion of sales in the UK. By any measure our service is industry- leading, and it represents a world-class platform from which to build our position of leadership in the multichannel world. Our Delivery Saver subscription service, which only launched in May 2012, is used by over 200,000 customers. We offer one-hour delivery slots in over 98% of the UK and Grocery Click & Collect is available at 260 locations. 
Tesco has always been about making products previously seen as unattainable more accessible. So we were especially proud of the launch of Hudl – our very own tablet – which made tablet devices much more accessible to more families across the UK. It proved extremely popular with customers, exceeding our own expectations, and earned outstanding reviews from the technology press. It was recently named ‘ReThink Retail Technology Initiative of the Year’ at the Retail Week Awards and we plan to launch a second device later this year. 
Accelerating our plans for customers in the UK I am clear that we have strengthened the foundations of the UK business, but I am also clear that we need to do more. Above all else, we are focused on delivering the most compelling offer for customers and we are accelerating our plans. Consequently, over the coming months you will see a continuing focus on every day low prices on the lines that 
matter most, more product innovation and quality improvements that delight, new and improved general merchandise ranges and more Extra stores becoming destinations worth a trip in their own right, while our convenience stores will be best in class. 
Our attention to service levels will intensify and we will deliver exceptional value for customers through Clubcard, just as we are doing through the recent launch of Clubcard Fuel Save. 
It is this combination of accelerating growth in new channels while investing in sharper prices, improved quality, stronger ranges and better service that places a strain on short-term results. But it is also this combination of actions and strategic choice that will deliver sustainable long-term value. Where we have moved – for example in ending the UK space race, in focusing on cash and capital discipline, in developing grocery home shopping – others in the sector have followed. Our aim is to continue to lead, recognising that structural change on this scale is a long game and it is in our interest – and your interest – to be a long-term winner. 
2. Establishing multichannel leadership in all of our markets Against the backdrop of an accelerating shift to online shopping, our priority of establishing multichannel leadership in all of our markets has never been more relevant. Customers’ behaviours are changing, their expectations of retailers continue to rise and they want to be able to shop however, whenever and wherever they want. We are moving from the first curve of retailing – one of bricks and mortar – to the second curve built around a seamless blend of bricks and clicks. 
Establishing multichannel leadership is about putting the customer at the centre of our offer and building a seamless experience around them, whether they want to shop in store, online, in our restaurants, at the Bank or across a combination of them all. Customer journeys are becoming more complex. Customers bounce between channels and devices in whichever way they choose and they expect a seamless experience. Our goal is to provide a zero-defect, end-to-end experience however our customers want to shop. While this presents challenges, it brings lots of opportunities too. Our scale, and our existing strengths from the first curve world, mean we are uniquely placed to lead in this new world. 
It is clear to us that those customers who choose to shop across more channels with us spend more and are more loyal to Tesco. Identifying our most valuable customers and enabling them to shop with us however, whenever and wherever they want is our opportunity. 
We have some ambitious goals and bold plans for our multichannel business in 
“The pace of the transition to online is rapid. This creates challenges for the industry but we 
have a market-leading, profitable grocery home shopping business.” 

Establishing multichannel leadership is about putting the customer at the centre of our offer and building a seamless experience around them, whether they want to shop in a store, online, in our restaurants, at the Bank or across a combination of them all.

Report from the Chief Executive continued 
“Through our international businesses we have the opportunity to create value for customers 
and shareholders by leveraging the know-how that we have gained from nine decades of retailing.” 
2014/15: to provide market-leading delivery pricing, twice the number of Click & Collect locations, including alternative locations such as London tube stations, and added-value products and services, including Tesco Bank’s current account and digital wallet. 
In the medium term, we will offer one-hour delivery slots to the whole of the UK, for non-food as well as food, and for third-party sellers as well as our own products. By doing so, we will effectively create an e-commerce infrastructure not just for Tesco but for others as well. It is because we have the potential to innovate on this scale that we believe your company will emerge a winner in the coming multichannel world of retailing. 
3. Pursuing disciplined international growth Last year, I described our international markets in three cohorts: 
	•	South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand – markets with significant future potential  
	•	Ireland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – markets where we are focused on holding our position and improving returns  
	•	China, India and Turkey – markets where we know we must refocus on a more profitable approach to growth  Through our international businesses we have the opportunity to create value for customers and shareholders by leveraging the know-how that we have gained from nine decades of retailing in addition to using our scale to better effect across the Group. As well as doing even more to improve our customer offer across all our markets, we’ve taken action to ensure that this value is realised across each of these three cohorts.  In line with our third strategic priority, we have applied an even greater level of capital discipline. While we continue to allocate capital to markets where we see greatest potential for growth, our investment is lower than previous years and will fall even further as part of our commitment that Group-wide capital expenditure will be no more than £2.5 billion for at least the next three financial years. We are spending more on our existing space due to our accelerated refresh programme, we are maintaining our level of spend on technology and we’re spending significantly less on new space.  Taking our Asian businesses first, we have a strong position in South Korea and it remains a high-returning business for us, but the sales trends have not been as we would have wanted them to be in the last two years. The regulatory restrictions on store opening hours have continued to impact our sales.  
Our work, however, to refresh seven of our largest stores, including our stores in Dongsuwon and Yuseong, has delivered encouraging results. We also continued to grow our convenience portfolio, with the opening of 71 ‘365 plus’ franchise stores. 
We have had a challenging year in Thailand, reflecting the impact of the recessionary conditions on consumers and the political unrest. Thailand is one of our largest international markets and we have implemented a strong plan to improve our offer. We have continued to build a strong multichannel business, growing our grocery home shopping and convenience businesses to almost 1,400 convenience stores. 
In Malaysia, our performance has been more resilient. We opened two new stores during the year and grew our grocery home shopping business in its first year of operation. 
In Europe, we faced weak momentum running into the start of the year and the challenges were common across our markets with larger stores under-performing. Addressing these challenges we have tailored our plans in each market to provide a more compelling fresh offer, focusing on seasonal events and leveraging our sourcing scale and supply chain capability. We have also used our strengths in Clubcard and F&F to drive further improvements in our offer for customers. Turkey in particular has faced very challenging economic and competitive conditions and our focus is on finding a profitable model for a country with excellent long-term potential. We are in early stage discussions with potential partners and, should that not prove successful, we also have a range of realistic alternative options. 
An excellent example of our strategy in action is our partnership with China Resources Enterprise Ltd. Subject to the usual regulatory approvals, it will give Tesco a 20% ownership stake of the largest food retail business in China. The joint venture, which will be self-funding going forward, will secure significant cost and operational synergies, and will move us more quickly to profitability in what is one of the world’s most exciting retail markets alongside an expert local partner. 
We have entered into an agreement with Trent Limited, part of the Tata Group, to form a 50:50 joint venture with Trent Hypermarket Limited, developing our presence in the Indian market. 
We firmly believe that our partnerships in both China and India will allow us to capitalise on these enormously exciting markets in a way which is disciplined in our use of capital and focused on profitable growth.

“We firmly believe that our partnerships in both China and India will allow us to capitalise on these enormously exciting markets in a way which is disciplined in our use of capital and focused on profitable growth.” 
Measuring our progress 
The single most important theme running through all the developments I have discussed is that stores are no longer necessarily the central point of our relationship with customers. Consequently we are re-orientating the indicators we use to measure and judge our progress 
to centre them firmly on the customer. 
Our customers are at the centre of all our strategic decisions. Quite simply, everything we are doing is designed to retain our loyal customers and attract more new ones who shop across our channels and brands. That is how companies build enduring like-for-like sales. We are prioritising five key performance indicators which will help us measure and communicate our progress against our strategy. These measures place customers, and how they want to shop today right at the heart of everything we do. Focusing on driving customer loyalty and improving sales will lead to sustainable profits, returns and growth over the medium term. 
You can read more about our new key performance indicators and how we are measuring performance of the business on pages 16 to 18. 
Tesco Bank 
Our vision is to be the bank for Tesco customers and to offer simple, transparent and convenient products which reward our customers’ loyalty and strengthen their bond with our business. 
This year we have seen good growth in our core banking products with customer accounts for credit cards, loans, mortgages and savings up 14%. In its first full year of trading, our mortgage product has made good progress with balances reaching £0.7 billion. We remain on track to launch current accounts in the first half of 2014/15. 
Using our scale for good 
Last year we embraced a new Value for the business, recognising that when you are a large company, there is a particular responsibility to be aware of how your actions affect others. This Value is: we use our scale for good. It is based on the recognition that if we harness the breadth of our skills and scale and work together with our partners in the supply chain, we can make a major contribution to some of the biggest challenges facing the communities in which we operate, across the world. As part of this, we chose to take a lead in addressing three challenges which are particularly relevant to us as a large global retailer and are important to our colleagues and customers: reducing food waste globally, improving health and providing opportunities for millions of young people. 
We have started the journey of tackling these issues and we are embedding this new Value 
throughout the business. One of the biggest changes we have made over the last year is in the scale of our engagement. We are joining the global conversation around each of the issues and are working hard to move to a more open, transparent conversation, sharing details of our activities, progress and challenges through our different channels. 
We want to make significant, lasting changes, not launch short-term superficial initiatives, and that’s why the focus of this year has been gathering the best possible insights to set long-term direction. 
This insight-to-action approach holds the key to our success for the future. It’s the theme of this year’s Tesco and Society report, which is published alongside this report. I’m confident that if we continue down this path over the coming years, we can use our scale for good across society and make what matters better, together. 
Management 
I would like to thank Laurie McIlwee for his contribution as CFO over the last five years, in particular to the progress we have made on our strategic priorities in the last three years, and before that his very good work on UK distribution. I wish him all the best for the future. 
Our Executive Committee has grown stronger this year, welcoming Steve Rigby and David Hobbs, and I am confident that we have the right team to deliver our strategy. 
Conclusion 
While we do face short-term challenges, I am excited about the future. We see many more opportunities for the medium term and beyond. As customers’ expectations of retailers evolve and we move into the new era of retail, we believe we are uniquely placed to lead. 
Tesco has always innovated for its customers. We have the building blocks which will be essential for us to lead in the future: an industry-leading online offer, unrivalled customer insight through Clubcard, a first-class portfolio of stores, and an outstanding team of over 500,000 colleagues around the world who are working harder every day to deliver for our customers. In a rapidly changing market, retaining flexibility is essential and we are confident that we have a business plan which is right for today’s market, and that we are making the strategic decisions to deliver leadership in tomorrow’s market.

Market overview 
As customers increasingly choose to shop across different store formats and online, they are looking to retailers to provide a truly seamless, multichannel offer. These changes to customer behaviour and shopping habits come in the context of continuing economic pressure on household budgets and competitive environments in all 12 of our markets. 
Macro trends 
The economic environment has continued to be challenging in all of our markets. Although there are signs of improvement beginning to appear, we don’t yet see consumers spending more. 
 
In the UK, we use our unique insight from dunnhumby to track how British consumers feel about the economy in general, as well as their own individual situations. Our latest quarterly Consumer Today report shows that although some consumers are starting to feel more upbeat about an improving economy, they are yet to feel the benefit in their own pockets. That is why we remain very focused on helping customers to manage their budgets by offering them great value for money across their shop. 
In Central Europe, after a prolonged period of economic pressure, employment levels and consumer confidence are rising, albeit from historically low levels, and real incomes are starting to benefit from lower inflation. Nonetheless, household expenditure is yet to improve significantly. 
Although some economies in Asia are rapidly expanding, Thailand fell into recession during the year and consumers struggled with higher levels of debt. Thai consumer confidence was further affected by the escalation of political unrest in the second half of the year. In South Korea consumer confidence has been on a marked upward trend through the year but household debt has reached record highs. Consumer confidence in Malaysia has fallen due to concerns over inflation, low wage growth and a proposed sales tax. 
Populations are ageing and household sizes are declining across our markets. In Asia for example, 50% of South Korean households 
comprise one or two people – a trend also seen in Thailand, in part due to rapid urbanisation. This changing household composition is one factor leading to an increasing preference for convenience shopping. 
We believe that in the longer term rising populations, rapid urbanisation and a growing demand for agricultural products present a risk to global food security and highlight the importance of building sustainable supply chains.* 
* More information about our work to increase the sustainability of our supply chain is available in the Tesco and Society Report.

Technology is changing the way we consume. The role that it plays in customers’ lives has changed as it becomes a fundamental, essential part of everyday life – a way to stay connected, to manage banking and bills, a part of education and often essential for work. While the pace of adoption of online shopping, particularly for groceries, across our markets is unclear, the transition is certainly well underway. It is not just transactional – consumers are increasingly using the internet to research purchases. 
In the UK, for example, over half of purchases are influenced by digital channels, 63% of shoppers use their smartphone in store and 43% of customers use a mobile phone to compare prices or look up customer reviews while shopping in store. The influence of the internet is rising across all our markets; two thirds of Malaysians have access to the internet, for example, while almost half of Czechs own a smartphone.

Multichannel 

Multichannel cuts across the digital and the physical. It is transactional and non-transactional. It is not just about selling products but also about the way we interact with and engage customers. Being truly multichannel is not just about having a website – it is about putting the customer at the heart of our business and giving them one seamless, joined-up relationship, be that through media, social media or even a customer service desk in store.

With this rise of technology and digital capabilities, consumers are changing the way they shop. Customers want to be able to shop however, whenever and wherever they want. They want to shop across store formats, on smartphones and on tablets. They are no longer choosing just a simple trip to a store, but are making much more dynamic and complex journeys to purchase. They are bouncing between channels, placing an order online and picking it up in store, for example. They are combining fewer big shopping trips with more frequent, top-up shops at convenience stores. As their behaviour is changing their expectations

In the UK, food retail sales growth has remained subdued over the last year, reflecting the challenging economic environment and continuing pressure on consumers. 
the proportion of customers shopping three or more times a week for food and groceries is up from 29% in 2009 to 49% in 2013. 
Health and wellbeing is also a growing trend. Over half of the UK population worry about their health and food is at the centre. Quality fresh food and provenance are priorities for customers across our regions. In Europe and the UK, interest in and awareness of provenance have intensified since the meat contamination issues last year. In Asia wet-markets continue to be a popular choice for fresh meat, fish and poultry. 
of retailers are changing too and they are looking to retailers to provide a truly multichannel offer – one that joins up all the different channels to give them a seamless experience. 
Value continues to be a priority for consumers across our markets and they are changing the way they shop in order to find the best value for money. They are on the look-out for the best prices, promotions and deals. The sharp rises in fuel prices across the world coupled with pressure on disposable income has amplified a shift to smaller, more frequent, convenience shopping missions. In the UK, 
  
In the UK, food retail sales growth has remained subdued over the last year, reflecting the challenging economic environment and continuing pressure on consumers. Although new space has been a key driver of top-line growth for many in the industry, we have seen a reduction in large store openings. In the UK net new space among the largest four grocery retailers in 2013 was 38% lower than in 2009. In many of our markets performance of larger stores has been more challenged. 
In response to a consumer desire to shop more frequently and closer to home, many retailers are focusing their opening programmes on the convenience market and smaller format stores. An acceleration in openings of small format stores is something we have also observed in our European and Asian markets. 
In the UK the online grocery market has continued to grow strongly, with all the major UK food retailers now operating a grocery home shopping service. We have also seen a rapid growth in Click & Collect over the last year, including trials of non-store collection locations. While online grocery is still in its infancy in Central Europe and Asia we expect it to continue to grow. In Poland, for example, the value 
of the online food market doubled in size from 2008 to 2011, and is expected to have more than doubled again by 2014. 
Across our markets the industry remains highly competitive. In the UK and Europe the discounters continue to grow market share and open new stores. Promotional intensity has remained elevated in the UK and couponing has been a feature in many of our markets. 
We have seen continued development of own-brand products by retailers across the globe as they seek to appeal to broader groups of consumers and respond to demand for better value.

Our core activities 
38 million 
Clubcard customers shopping in our 7,300 stores across the Group give us unrivalled insight into consumer habits, trends and preferences. 
As a retailer, our business model is based on four core activities. Using our unrivalled insight to understand what customers want, we buy products and services from suppliers, move them through our distribution network and sell them to customers. Most importantly, our core purpose is at the heart of these activities. It is by improving these activities for customers each time they shop with us that we make what matters better, together. 
Across the Group, our customers visit us in store, online, or through a combination of different formats and channels. They come to buy their groceries, clothing, general merchandise and services such as telecoms, digital entertainment and banking. We are focused on providing customers with the most compelling offer and the best shopping trip. We work with our suppliers to offer an excellent range of products and services. We move the products through our modern and efficient supply chain into our well-located, multi-format store network, ready for customers to shop with us 24 hours a day. 
The core activities form a cycle. To keep customers coming back, we are constantly strengthening our operation. This starts with insight. We listen to customers in a number of ways, including through our monthly Customer Viewpoint surveys in UK stores, in-depth focus groups with our Tesco Families and dedicated Customer Question Time sessions. Combining this feedback with our data, including the unique insight we gain from Clubcard, and acting on it is crucial to our success. 
Our seven key enablers are our business strengths. They help us to sustain and improve our core activities. These elements are what make us different and it’s because of these that we are uniquely placed to win. 
For example, establishing multichannel leadership and building a seamless offer will enable customers to shop however, whenever and wherever they want, which will mean that we stand out for customers. 
Another example is leveraging our Group skill and scale, which is all about sharing our experiences across our operations. We trial in one area of the business and transfer the learnings to another, whether it’s sharing the loyalty scheme blueprint internationally or building capital-efficient grocery home shopping businesses in new markets. Being able to leverage our Group skill and scale makes us unique and helps us to perform the core activities even better. 
The momentum of our business model comes from the virtuous circle. By developing economies of scale and investing in an ever-improving customer offer, we drive loyalty and grow sales. 
Developing and using economies of scale across our business all over the world, enables us to improve the customer offer by investing in areas such as price, range, quality and service. This year, for example, we completed the roll-out of grocery home shopping to all of our markets (except India). It is a service we developed in the UK and have rolled out in a capital-efficient way to our international businesses, with a great customer response. 
Doing the right thing for customers is central to the business model. It’s why one of our Values is ‘no-one tries harder for customers’; we know that if we do the right thing for customers, they will reward us with their loyalty. The more pleased customers are with the shopping trip, the more loyal they will be and the more we will grow our sales. This combination of scale and growth is the driving force of the business model. 
The key enablers 
59.7% of our UK customers shop across two or more channels, 
including stores and online. 
The virtuous circle 
12 markets 
with retail operations delivering 85 million customer shopping trips each week.

Excluding our Chinese business, Group ROCE for 2013/14 was 13.6%. 
Group results and strategic update 
Group sales for the year were £70.9 billion, an increase of 0.3% at actual exchange rates. Full-year trading profit for our continuing operations declined (6.0)% to £3.3 billion. This was driven by a decline in UK profits and challenges overseas; specifically, the regulatory impact in South Korea, political disruption in Thailand and continuing challenging conditions in Central Europe. Underlying profit before tax1, which excludes the contribution from property-related items, declined (6.9)% to £3.1 billion. Underlying diluted earnings per share was 32.05 pence. 
During the year, we concluded our strategic review in the United States with the sale of the substantive part of Fresh & Easy’s operating business to Yucaipa. We also announced our partnership with China Resources Enterprise Ltd. (CRE), which when completed will give Tesco a 20% ownership stake in the largest food retail business in China. Both of those operations are therefore shown as discontinued. 
Reflecting the challenging trading conditions and rapidly changing environments, we have also announced a number of one-off charges. £(801) million2 of these are in continuing operations. These include: 
• A non-cash impairment of £(734) million to the carrying values of some stores in the Europe segment. 
• An additional £(63) million provision for payment protection insurance and other customer redress at the Bank. 
Our statutory profit before tax for the year was £2.3 billion. Despite these charges and a lower contribution from profits and losses on property-related items, Group profit before tax increased by 9.8%, primarily reflecting higher one-off charges last year.

12 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
There is a £(540) million write-down of goodwill in our Chinese business included in discontinued operations. This prudently reflects the lower end of a range of independent valuations of the proposed combination carried out in the second half of the year for accounting purposes. These valuations were, as required by the relevant accounting standards, produced on a standalone existing basis for each business. As such, they do not take account of the strategic value and significant synergies available once the businesses are merged. 
Segmental results 
UK 
Full-year sales in the UK declined by (0.1)% and grew by 0.8% excluding petrol. Like-for-like sales declined by (1.3)% including VAT and excluding petrol. This reflects the weaker grocery market, lower inflation across the industry, a continuing drag from our large stores and the work to transform our general merchandise. 
a particularly important category for small traders who shop with us. The Thai economy also fell into recession during the year and this has since been compounded by the recent political unrest. 
The full-year numbers for Asia benefited from currency, but in the fourth quarter we saw a negative impact, driven by the Thai Baht. Whilst it is difficult to predict currency movements going forward, this impact has continued into the new financial year. 
South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand remain markets in which we see significant future potential and opportunities to invest in high-returning stores. We have opened 2.1 million square feet of new space in these markets this year, a reduction compared to the 2.3 million we opened last year. In the coming year we intend to be even more focused with plans to open 1.2 million square feet, with much of it in convenience. 
Europe 
Conditions in Europe have remained challenging this year, particularly for our large stores. Sales declined (2.0)% at constant rates. Like-for- like sales declined by (3.5)% excluding petrol. Our trading profit for the region declined by (27.7)% at actual exchange rates to £238 million, resulting in a 2.57% trading margin. Our decision to invest in the shopping trip through price, quality, range and service resulted in a stronger second half performance. The region’s like-for-like sales have improved through the year, from (5.5)% in the first quarter to (0.6)% in the fourth quarter. 
Reflecting the year-on-year decline in the profits of our European businesses, we revised our long-term budgets. These revisions have resulted in the asset impairment of £(734) million to the carrying value of these businesses.

Our full-year trading margin was 5.03%, a reduction of (18) basis points. Trading margin in the first half increased by 2 basis points, but declined by (28) basis points in the second half. This is reflective of our trading performance and our determination to improve and strengthen the customer offer. 
Asia 
Although we have strong high-returning businesses in Asia with leading market positions, their performance this year reflects a number of challenges. Sales grew by 1.4% at constant rates, including a 5.9% contribution from new stores as we continue to invest in these growth markets. Like-for-like sales declined by (4.5)% and our trading margin declined by almost 60 basis points to 6.71%.

Poland was a particular focus for us in the year and we are pleased with the customer response to our plans, with an improved like-for-like sales trend through the year. 
Ireland has continued to be a difficult market this year with severe pressure on consumer spending, strong competition from the discounters and aggressive couponing activity. Although the launch of Price Promise in the second half has helped improve customer trust in our prices, and we have been working hard to show customers the breadth and points of difference in our offer, our weaker trading performance in this market has impacted on the profitability of our European segment. 
We have continued to focus on the heartland of our business in Turkey and the stores there have contributed to a gradual improvement in like-for-like sales over the year. Nevertheless, addressing our position in Turkey is very much a priority. 
We continue to be very disciplined in our allocation of capital to Europe. We have reduced capital expenditure in the region by nearly 40% this year, and expect to maintain a similar or lower level of spend in 2014/15. Going forward, new investment will be scarce and focused only on targeted opportunities, primarily in convenience and online.

Exc. China, with our subsidiary there now treated as a discontinued operation following our agreement to partner with CRE. 
Although we have annualised the introduction of the DIDA opening hours regulations in South Korea, year-on-year changes in the days and hours of the closures have continued to impact sales. We have worked hard to mitigate the residual effects of the regulation by fully aligning our operations to the current pattern of trading. 
In Thailand, our performance has been held back by our own execution as well as external pressures. We implemented a strong plan, including steps to address some parts of our offer which underperformed in the first half. This included the remerchandising and remarketing of our ‘Clubpack’ range of bulk buy products,

Financial review continued Tesco Bank 
Tesco Bank generated £194 million trading profit this year. Excluding income from the legacy insurance distribution agreement which terminated in 2012/13 and fair value releases resulting from the unwind of an acquisition accounting adjustment, it grew by 19%. 
We have seen good growth in our core banking products with customer accounts for credit cards, loans, mortgages and savings up 14%. After the first full year of trading, mortgage balances have grown to £0.7 billion and we have helped over 4,000 customers to own their homes. Those customers have borrowed an average of just under £170,000 with a loan-to-value ratio of just over 50%. Reflecting the challenging market conditions, with increased competition driving a marked reduction in premiums across the industry, the profit contribution of our Insurance business was down (17)% this year (excluding legacy income). 
We are spending significantly less on new space. In the UK we have already reduced our investment from 2.5 million square feet at peak. In the coming year, we will open just 0.9 million square feet of net new space. This includes almost 200,000 square feet of franchise space in One Stop. In Europe, we will open just 275,000 square feet of net new space and focus more of our investment on high-returning opportunities in Asia. 
Property 
The market value of our property across the Group currently exceeds £34 billion, with the most significant driver of the reduction since last year being the impact of foreign exchange rates. 
Historically, by acquiring and developing high-quality stores we grew the value of our property significantly and unrealised property profits built up. We have had an active programme of releasing value from our property portfolio over many years. We continue to look at our property portfolio in order to maximise value in the most appropriate way for the business as a whole. Excluding one-off items, profits arising from property-related items declined to £180 million this year, in line with the reduction of our sale and leaseback programme outlined last year. This year we have focused on South Korea and we completed a sale-and-leaseback in January comprising four Homeplus stores and accompanying mall space. 
Pension 
Our pension is an extremely valuable benefit for colleagues and one we are proud to offer. IFRS accounting gives a marked-to- market measure of our pension liabilities, based on market conditions which of course can be volatile in the short term, whereas the liabilities are clearly long-term in nature. 
Our after-tax IAS 19 pension deficit this year has risen to £2.6 billion, mainly due to a reduction in real corporate bond yields with a subsequent fall in the discount rate used to measure our liabilities. A triennial actuarial valuation will be carried out to measure our liabilities as at 31 March 2014 and this will be completed in 2015. 
Return on capital employed 
When we complete our partnership with CRE, our Group return on capital employed will reflect our share of the partnership’s assets and profits or losses. Given that we expect to complete the partnership in the first half of 2014/15 we have given a pro-forma Group ROCE including our Chinese business. On this basis, our Group ROCE was 12.1%, which is a comparable figure to the 12.7% we reported last year. Excluding our Chinese business based on its current accounting treatment as a discontinued operation, our Group ROCE would be 13.6%. 
The UK continues to earn the highest returns in the Group and our businesses in Asia are high-returning. Europe’s returns remain below cost of capital. We will continue to limit capital expenditure in this region and focus our efforts on improving our offer for customers in existing stores.

The Bank will soon complete its suite of products with a current account launching in the first half. We expect the growth in underlying trading profit in 2014/15 to be broadly offset by the investment in current accounts. 
Within one-off items, the Bank has made a further increase to the provision for payment protection insurance of £(20) million and a provision of £(43) million for other customer redress. 
The Bank’s balance sheet remains strong with good levels of liquidity. Although customer deposits remain the primary source of funding, the funding base was diversified during the year with a credit card securitisation and participation in the Funding for Lending scheme. 
Group balance sheet and cash flow 
Net debt has remained stable year-on-year at £6.6 billion. In the context of declining underlying profit, lower property proceeds and a maintained dividend, this demonstrates our discipline and focus on cash. 
Two metrics that we use to guide our internal decisions and which support our discipline to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating are net indebtedness and fixed charge cover. This year net indebtedness rose slightly to 3.16 times and fixed charge cover remained stable at 3.4 times. 
This year we spent £2.7 billion of capex, or £3.0 billion including China. We are reducing our capital expenditure to no more than £2.5 billion for at least the next three years. A greater proportion of this reduced overall spend is devoted to our existing stores. We are accelerating our refresh programme in the UK and we are also maintaining our level of spend on technology to ensure that we have the necessary capabilities for a truly multichannel offer. 

14 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Our approach to growth and returns 
We laid out this financial framework in April 2013 and it continues to inform our decisions. The framework helps ensure an appropriate balance of growth, returns and cash generation, and outlines what shareholders can expect from Tesco from a financial perspective in the medium term. 
Financial disciplines Guiderails 
The changes we have announced to capital expenditure underpin our commitment to this framework. This moves capital expenditure to the bottom of our 4% down to 3.5% of sales guiderail. This even greater focus on capital discipline will help maintain the commitment to generate positive free cash flow, maintain a strong balance sheet, and continue to maintain a strong dividend. 
I wish Philip and the team well and am absolutely confident that Tesco will emerge from this period of unprecedented change in the industry stronger than ever.

Key performance indicators 
With our strategy now focused on delivering even greater loyalty from our customers, we place even greater emphasis across the business on improving five customer-focused key performance indicators. Whilst we continue to track a range of financial and non-financial measures, it is these five which each of our businesses now uses to gauge progress. 
Key performance indicators of our strategic performance 
We have entered the new, multichannel world of retail and customers’ expectations have changed. Customers have increased access to more and more retailers simply at their search bar on their smartphone and our success will be a result of more customers choosing Tesco in preference to others. 
As a result of this fundamental change, we have prioritised our customer-focused measures to track and communicate our progress against the strategy. We believe these five KPIs are more relevant today, during this time of transition and transformation, than some of our historical and short-term measures. 
Everything we are doing to create the most compelling offer is designed to retain our most loyal customers, attract new ones and allow them to shop however, whenever and wherever they want to. These measures both allow us to monitor our progress and to create value because they are entirely focused on customers and how they choose to shop. Greater loyalty delivers greater lifetime value so we are tracking the behaviours of our loyal Clubcard customers – those who are most engaged and typically spend more with us. Focusing on our loyal customers is how we are driving the transformation we are going through and is how we will build enduring like-for-like sales. 
The measures contained in this section are for our core UK business where they are particularly relevant. They do however apply to every part of our business – whether it’s a store, a category, a country or a department – and we are using them across the Group to drive the behaviours that we believe will lead to long-term success. 
                                           
1. Our customers come back time and again 
2. New customers choose us 
70.0% retained loyal customers 
Definition: Percentage of last year’s loyal customers* who are still loyal to Tesco Commentary: Doing the right thing for our loyal customers and retaining their loyalty is our first priority. The more we get it right for them, the more all customers will benefit. 
29.1% of new loyal customers 
Definition: New loyal customers* as a percentage of last year’s loyal customer base Commentary: We want to build our loyal customer base so in addition to retaining our existing loyal customers, we want to attract new ones. Our investments in the customer offer are designed to create long-term value for new customers too. 
   
3. Our customers can shop how they want 
4. Our customers use us for more Definition: Percentage of loyal 
59.7% customers shopping across channels 
5. Loved by customers 
64.3% shop the family brands 
Definition: Percentage of loyal customers* who in the last 13 weeks have shopped two or more channels** Commentary: This measure helps us to monitor whether we are providing the truly multichannel offer that customers want in the new era of retailing. We know that customers who shop across channels spend more with us and this measure tracks whether they are shopping between different sized stores, grocery online and services. 
Our final measure is one of customer advocacy. Whilst the first four are functional measures, we know that for our brand to be loved, liked or actively chosen, our emotional connection with our customers must get stronger. Emotionally loyal customers, advocates and fans become brilliant ambassadors and drive 
customers* who in the last 13 weeks have bought / held products from Bank, Telecoms, Clothing*** Commentary: Our multichannel, multibrand strategy is founded in the belief that the whole is more than the sum of the parts. This measure tracks whether we are building loyalty and value across our brands and channels. 
  
* Loyal customers are defined based on their frequency of spend and average weekly spend. ** Channels include: large stores, convenience stores, grocery home shopping, Tesco Direct and Wine by the case. *** Current results do not include Blinkbox, Clothing online, Nutricentre, Dobbies and our new coffee shops and restaurants. These will be tracked going forward.

Performance 
Capex was £2.7 billion, a similar level to 2012/13 on a continuing operations basis*. It fell significantly in Europe and the UK and increased in Asia, in line with our priority for disciplined international growth. 
* The 2012/13 figure including China was 4.1%. 
Performance 
Group ROCE was 12.1% as a result of our profit performance. Given that we expect to complete the partnership with CRE this year, we have given a pro-forma ROCE including our Chinese business. This is directly comparable to last year’s published figure. Excluding China based on its current accounting treatment as a discontinued operation, our ROCE would be 13.6%.

UK like-for-like (the growth in sales from stores that have been open for at least a year) was (0.5)% for the first half and (2.2)% in the second half. Further weakness in the grocery market, exacerbated by a lower level of inflation, impacted our sales performance towards the end of the year and this contributed to the overall sales performance for the year.

Performance 
This year we fulfilled our commitment to improve our anonymous partner viewpoint survey by making it more comprehensive and ensuring it reaches more suppliers. The survey is helping us to understand more about how our supplier partners are feeling, and allows us to focus on the categories and countries where we need to work harder to ensure we always treat our partners with respect. We are committed to building longer-term strong strategic relationships, and our teams are very focused on improving this score.

We have donated almost £53 million to charities and good causes this year through direct donations, cause-related marketing, gifts in kind, colleague time and management costs. This represents 2.3% of our statutory profit before tax. The total that we have donated is lower this year, largely due to the transition from Tesco for Schools and Clubs to our Eat Happy initiative.

It also shows how we are strengthening our work in the four essential areas – trading responsibly, reducing our impact on the environment, being a great employer and supporting local communities – which are fundamental to the way we do business.

Respecting human rights 
As a global multichannel retailer we buy, move and sell products through our stores and online and our business interacts with millions of people every day. We have a responsibility to respect the human rights of our colleagues, our customers, the communities we operate in and the people who work throughout our supply chain. 
Our approach 
We are committed to upholding basic human rights and support in full the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization Core Conventions. We were a founding member of the Ethical Trading Initiative and expect all our suppliers to work towards fully implementing the base code. We investigate allegations of human rights infringements and take appropriate action where necessary. To review our policy visit www.tescoplc.com/society/resources. 
In addressing human rights we consider our potential impacts on the following groups as a priority: 
	•	Our colleagues: Our people policies are designed to make Tesco a great place to work where everyone is welcome  
	•	Our supply chain: Building strong partnerships with trusted suppliers will ensure that we deliver high-quality and safe products that are responsibly produced  
	•	Our customers and the communities in which we operate: Our customers want to buy high-quality products that are produced safely and responsibly. We want to be a good neighbour wherever we operate.  Through our scale for good strategy we are addressing some of the key challenges that societies are facing which are closely aligned to specific human rights as defined by the UN. For example:  
	•	Right to education – we are working to provide opportunities for millions of young people  
	•	Right to be free from hunger – we are building close relationships with food banks and food surplus charities who are helping to feed people in need  
	•	Right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health – we are helping our colleagues and customers to lead healthier lives.  The complexity of addressing human rights risks and concerns should not be underestimated. We believe that openness and responsiveness are essential in the identification and remedy of issues. We also understand we can not always address issues alone  
and so are committed to working in partnership with relevant stakeholders to make improvements. 
Governance and monitoring 
Our governance committees consider financial and non-financial risks to our business and the Compliance and Social Responsibility Committees in particular consider risks related to our Human Rights Policy, which are maintained on our company risk register. Key elements of our Human Rights Policy are incorporated into our Code of Business Conduct which is reviewed by our senior managers once a year. 
Our established ‘protector line’ is primarily used by colleagues and contractors to report suspected breaches of our Code of Business Conduct or internal company policies. Next year we are launching an independent ‘protector line’ service for use by any of our suppliers. Their employees will be able to raise confidentially concerns of wrongdoing in the provision of either goods or services for or on behalf of Tesco. Issues will be recorded, investigated and where necessary action will be taken. 
Improvement 
In 2013, we commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to carry out an analysis of our Human Rights Policy. Based on these findings we are revising our policy. This includes putting more emphasis on our human rights responsibilities in a revised Code of Business Conduct. 
Diversity 
We approach diversity in its broadest sense, recognising that successful world-class businesses flourish through embracing intellectual, experiential, geographical and skills diversity as well as other factors such as age, disability, gender, race and sexual orientation. The ratio of male to female colleagues, based on the number of employees at year end, is outlined below: 
Male Female 
Board of Directors 8 
Senior managers – 667 Directors 
Senior managers – 3,994 Directors and managers 
All employees 216,763 
Senior roles are demanding for all – regardless of gender – and we are determined to develop a culture and environment where people can advance. We introduced a ‘Women in Leadership’ development programme in 2011 and so far a total of 440 female colleagues have completed or are currently on the programme.

Greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emission reporting 
This year our carbon footprint was 6.37 million tonnes of CO2e. Our overall carbon intensity has decreased by 35% since 2006/07. 
We have calculated our carbon footprint according to the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas (‘GHG’) Protocol. We follow the operational control approach and use emission factors from Defra/DECC’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2013. For more information on our carbon targets and how we calculate our carbon footprint, including reporting standards, the definition of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, and ERM CVS’s Independent Assurance Statement, see www.tescoplc.com/society/resources.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
A key challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to develop and monitor appropriate controls. A successful risk management process balances risks and rewards and relies on sound judgement of their likelihood and impact. The Group maintains a Key Risk Register of the principal risks faced by the Group, including the likelihood and impact of risks and the controls and procedures implemented to mitigate them. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail on page 40 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. 
The table below sets out the principal risks faced by the Group, and examples of relevant key controls and mitigating factors. The Board considers these to be the most significant risks faced by the Group. They do not comprise all the risks associated with the Group and they are not set out in any order of priority. Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business. 
As customers’ disposable income remains stretched, the competitive intensity of the retail marketplace also continues to grow. It is against this backdrop that there has been a trend towards increasing net risk during the year. 
Whilst the economic situation in our principal market, the UK, is beginning to show some improvement, there are increased levels of economic, political and regulatory volatility in the wider global marketplace which have increased the assessed level of net risk that the business faces in these areas. The ongoing austerity programmes in Asia and Europe and the fiscal and regulatory measures that apply to the retail sector, for example the DIDA Act in South Korea, have continued to challenge the business. An increase in the rating of economic, political and regulatory risks since last year is principally driven by a revised view of the likely impact of these risks on the business, particularly in the context of the global marketplace and the financial and trading position of the Group. 
The ongoing delivery of our multichannel vision, combined with a growing focus on customer data, has also heightened our sensitivity to the impact of technology risks. The impact assessment of technology has therefore increased and this remains a key area of focus. 
Significant efforts by management to mitigate risks and strengthen controls have reduced the assessment of the likelihood of certain risks occurring. Notable examples include: product safety and ethical trading, reputation and property. Changes to the Group’s property strategy in the year have also reduced the overall property net risk rating. 
Principal risks 
Business strategy 
If our strategy follows the wrong direction or is not effectively communicated or implemented, the business may suffer 
The retail industry is undergoing a transformational change in this digital age. The challenge is in balancing investment and the emphasis between traditional and new 
Investor support may be impacted if it takes longer than expected to demonstrate that our strategy is the right one, or if we cannot make the investments required 
An unclear or unsuccessful strategy against the growth of budget retailers could adversely impact our market share and profitability 
Our ability to operate successfully in international markets may be restricted if we do not follow the right strategy in each market, which in turn could adversely impact the Group’s profitability 
Financial strategy 
Risks relate to an incorrect or unclear financial strategy and the failure to achieve financial plans 
There are risks that our financial guiderails will not be achieved, or if achieving them means that the business is stretched in the short-term at the expense of investment in our long-term strategy 
Weak performance could put pressure on free cash flow and credit metrics and affect our credit rating 
Key controls and mitigating factors 
• Strategic matters are regularly reviewed by the Board and Executive Committee; the Board dedicates two full days a year to testing and challenging Group strategy 
• Our plan is clear and focused on our three priorities: a strong UK business; multichannel leadership; and disciplined international growth 
• A disciplined approach is taken with underperforming assets and decisive action is taken on strategy as appropriate, including the recent decisions regarding operations in the US, China and India. See the Chairman’s statement and the Report from the Chief Executive on pages 1 to 7 
for more details • We continue to invest in the customer offer through initiatives such as Price 
Promise, which aim to improve customer perception of our relative price position • The structure of our executive sub-committees is designed to focus on key risks through the work of the Group Commercial, Compliance, 
Multichannel, Technology, People Matters Group, Property Strategy 
and Social Responsibility Committees • Significant resource is invested to communicate strategy effectively to 
those delivering it • Consistent operational plans are developed throughout the Group 
to ensure delivery • A Steering Wheel balanced scorecard system helps to monitor delivery • Structured stakeholder engagement programmes are conducted; an 
investor and analyst seminar was hosted in February 2014 to reiterate our strategic priorities 
• Financial strategy risks and performance are regularly reviewed by the Board and Executive Committee, with external advice obtained as required 
• We have set clear expectations for the market with our financial disciplines and guiderails: improving capital discipline; greater focus on balancing growth with returns; and being more focused on cash rather than margins. See the Financial review on pages 12 to 15 for more details 
• The Balance Sheet Committee regularly reviews gearing and net debt management 
• Consistent operational plans and budgets are developed throughout the Group to help drive delivery 
• ASteeringWheelbalancedscorecardsystemhelpstomonitordelivery • Structured stakeholder engagement programmes are conducted so that 
expectations are clear

Principal risks 
Competition and consolidation 
Failure to compete on areas including price, product range, quality and multichannel service in increasingly competitive UK and overseas retail markets could impact our market share and adversely affect the Group’s financial results 
New entrants to the market and the consolidation of competitors through mergers or trade agreements in key markets or geographical areas could adversely impact our market share 
Reputational risk 
Failure to protect the Group’s reputation and brand in the face of ethical, legal, moral or operational challenges could lead to a loss of trust and confidence and a decline in customer base, and also affect our ability to recruit and retain good people 
If we do not make positive contributions to society and effectively communicate these, this may adversely impact our ability to win and retain customer trust and loyalty 
Key controls and mitigating factors 
• Our strategy to have broad appeal on price, range and format and to take the lead as a multichannel business, allows us to compete in different markets 
• A more diversified portfolio, such as our new food experience investments in Giraffe, Harris and Hoole and Euphorium, allows us to take advantage of new retailing opportunities 
• Our Executive and Multichannel Committees and Trading Groups regularly review markets, trading opportunities and competitor activities, including discounter growth, convenience and online activities 
• We continue to innovate and invest in online and multichannel activities, including our grocery, clothing and general merchandise offerings in the UK and internationally 
• Increased global marketing efforts aim to maximise the impact of our brand and intellectual property 
• Performance is tracked against relevant KPIs and measures that customers tell us are critical to their shopping experience 
• Customer perceptions of Tesco and competitors are constantly monitored to allow us to respond quickly and appropriately 
• Tesco Values are at the heart of how we do business to help us to consistently and transparently do the right thing for customers, colleagues and society as a whole 
• Through our newest Value – ‘we use our scale for good’ – we are tackling some of the most important issues for society: creating opportunities for young people, improving health, and reducing food waste. These ambitions build on the essential work we do every day as a responsible business: trading responsibly, reducing our impact on the environment, being a great employer and supporting local communities 
• We have established an external advisory panel of experts to challenge and help shape the strategic direction of this important work. See our Tesco and Society Report 2014 for more details 
• Communication and engagement programmes help us to understand stakeholder views and reflect them in our strategy and policies 
• Building strong relationships with our trading partners (suppliers) allows us to recognise and anticipate changes in our industry so we can continue to provide quality, affordable products at a great price and which are sourced responsibly 
• Our embedded Group Code of Business Conduct, Bribery Act and UK Groceries Supply Code of Practice guidelines guide our behaviour in dealing with customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders 
• Comprehensive and improved supplier auditing and product surveillance programmes are in place to minimise the risks associated with product integrity and labour standards 
• Governance committees, including the Executive, Corporate Responsibility, Group Commercial, Social Responsibility, Compliance, Multichannel and Technology Committees, guide and monitor policies 
• Our Board, Executive Committee and various operational committees, including the UK Operating Board, meet regularly to review performance risks 
• All business units have stretching targets based on a Steering Wheel balanced scorecard system; performance against budgets and KPIs are monitored continually and reported regularly to the Board 
• Clear budgets, goals and objectives are set for subsidiary CEOs, with a high proportion of reward based on the achievement of stretching targets 
• Our diversification strategy minimises the impact of changes in the economic climate 
• The regional alignment of shared opportunities leverages skill and scale to maximise performance 
• Clear and regular communications ensure that colleagues have confidence and belief in our long-term strategy and perform at their best without undue focus on short-term performance targets 
      
Performance 
If business units (including the UK) underperform against plan and against competitors, our business may fail to meet the stated strategy in full and impairment of asset values may result 
The delivery of long-term goals and sustainable performance may be impaired if the business focuses too heavily on short-term targets

Principal risks and uncertainties continued 
Principal risks 
Property 
The acquisition, development and management of property sites carry inherent risk. Challenges may arise in relation to obtaining planning or other consents; compliance with varying country safety, design and construction standards; tenant management; and maintaining a cost-effective estate with the right balance of freehold and leasehold sites 
Economic 
In each country where we operate, we are impacted by the underlying economic environment, the impact of austerity programmes on consumer spending and the fiscal measures that apply to the retail sector 
Political and regulatory 
In each country where we operate, we may be impacted by legal and regulatory changes, increased scrutiny by competition authorities and political developments relevant to domestic trade and the retail sector 
The regulatory landscape is becoming more restrictive in many markets, which may impact how we trade. Examples include stricter rules regarding opening hours, customer, supplier and data protection, corporate crime and heightened banking regulation 
Product safety and ethical trading 
Failures could damage customer trust and confidence, impacting our customer base and therefore financial results 
Key controls and mitigating factors 
• Calling an end to the ‘space race’ and our change of strategy in markets such as China has reduced property acquisition and development risk. There is now greater focus on repurposing space and managing our freehold and leasehold balance wisely and profitably 
• Group Property Strategy, Property Acquisition and related committees regularly review, and closely control, property acquisition, planning, construction and repurposing processes to ensure standards are met and risks are minimised

22 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Principal risks 
Technology 
Any significant failure in the IT processes of our retail operations, online and in stores, would impact our ability to trade 
As the digital marketplace grows, a lack of investment in technology, or investment in the wrong areas, may constrain multichannel growth and impact our competitiveness 
Insufficient investment in, or ineffective implementation of, controls over our online presence could increase the likelihood of a successful cyber-attack 
Whilst investment is made in new technologies, there is a risk that investment is not made to maintain the controls over the existing technology, which may impact systems availability and security, including the security of personnel, supplier or customer data 
As customers and colleagues become increasingly sensitive to matters of data usage, storage and security, the inherent reputational risks of the IT control environment have increased, in conjunction with the financial and regulatory risks 
People 
Failure to attract, retain, develop and motivate the best people with the right capabilities at all levels could limit our ability to succeed 
The world of multichannel retail is increasingly people-focused and demands new technical and social skills. Our leaders must play a critical role in helping to model the organisation we want to be 
Treasury 
Effective cash and debt management is critical to the running of the business. Failure to ensure the availability of funds to meet the needs of the business or to manage interest or exchange rate fluctuations or credit risks could limit our ability to trade profitably 
Key controls and mitigating factors 
• Our IT strategy is approved and reviewed by the Executive Committee to ensure that investments in IT systems and innovations improve business efficiency and customers’ shopping experience 
• We continue to invest in IT to respond to the growing range of IT-related threats and risks 
• The Group Technology Committee monitors controls to maintain the integrity and efficiency of our IT infrastructure and data

• Clear processes are in place to ensure we understand and respond to employees’ needs through our PMG, colleague surveys, regular performance reviews, the involvement of trade unions in relevant markets and the regular communication of business developments 
• Talent planning and people development is a key objective for each member of the Executive Committee 
• Significant investment is made in training, development and incentives, including through our Executive Committee Talent Cycle, talent planning, leadership development and succession planning for the future needs of the business 
• The Employment Policy Committee is responsible for the development of our Employment Policy Blueprint to ensure we have appropriate pay, pension and share plan arrangements to attract and retain good people across the business

• We expect our financial disciplines and guiderails to have a positive impact on cash and debt management 
• The Balance Sheet Committee meets regularly to monitor Treasury risks and manage the liquidity needs of the business

Principal risks 
Tesco Bank 
Financial risks taken by Tesco Bank (the ‘Bank’) could adversely impact the Group. The key financial risks relating to the Bank include interest rate, liquidity, credit and insurance risks which are detailed in Note 22 on page 107 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Changes to financial regulations, including in relation to credit card interchange fees, could impact banking profitability 
A vote in favour of Scottish independence from the UK in September 2014 could impact the fiscal, monetary and regulatory environment within which the Bank, which is headquartered in Edinburgh, operates 
Pensions 
The IAS 19 deficit could increase if there is a fall in corporate bond yields which is not offset by an increase in the pension scheme’s assets 
Other risks affecting the deficit are detailed in Note 26 on page 112 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 and include investment, inflation and life expectancy risks 
There are also increasing risks of legal and regulatory changes introducing more burdensome requirements 
Fraud, compliance and control 
As the business develops new platforms and grows in size, geographical scope and complexity, the potential for fraud and dishonest activity by our suppliers, customers and employees increases 
Key controls and mitigating factors

Financial risks review 
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and credit risks relating to the risk of default by parties to financial transactions. Further explanation of these risks is set out in Note 22 on page 104 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. An overview of the management of these risks is set out below for ease of reference and to support a further understanding of the principal treasury risks described in the table above. Details of the main financial risks relating to Tesco Bank and the management of those risks can be found in Note 22 on page 107 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. 

Financial risks 
Funding and liquidity risk 
The risk of being unable to continue to fund our operations on an ongoing basis 
Interest rate risk 
The risk to our profit and loss account resulting from rising interest rates 
Foreign exchange risk 
The risk that exchange rate volatility may have an adverse impact on our balance sheet or profit and loss account 
Credit risk 
The risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions 
Insurance risk 
The risk of being inadequately protected from liabilities arising from unforeseen events 
Key controls and mitigating factors 
• The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, disposals of property assets, debt capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases 
• New funding of £1.4 billion was raised during the year, including £0.8 billion from long term debt and £0.6 billion from property disposals. At the year end, net debt was £6.6 billion (2013: £6.6 billion) 
• The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. At the year end, the Group had a long-term credit rating of BBB+ (negative) from Fitch, Baa1 (negative) from Moody’s and BBB+ (stable) from Standard & Poor’s 
• Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and floors may be used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
• Our policy is to fix interest rates for the year on a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs of the Group excluding Tesco Bank. At the year end, the percentage of interest-bearing debt at fixed rates was 84% (2013: 75%). The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis this year, excluding joint ventures and associates, was 4.5% (2013: 4.8%) 
• Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are managed, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and purchased currency options. At the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent 
to £2,862 million were outstanding (2013: £1,835 million) as detailed in Note 21 on page 99 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. We translate overseas profits at average foreign exchange rates 
• We only hedge a proportion of the investment in our international subsidiaries as well as ensuring that each subsidiary is appropriately hedged in respect of its non-functional currency assets. During the year, currency movements decreased the net value, after the effects of hedging, of the Group’s overseas assets by £1,102 million (last year increase of £420 million) 
• The Group holds positions with an approved list of counter parties of good credit quality and these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored 
• We purchased assets, earnings and combined liability protection from the open insurance market for higher value losses only 
• The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business with some cover being provided by our captive insurance companies, ELH Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland. ELH Insurance Limited covers Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability, while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability only

Corporate governance report 

Sir Richard Broadbent 
Chairman 
In this section 
This Corporate Governance Report is intended to provide shareholders with a clear and comprehensive view of the Group’s governance arrangements and how they have operated over the past year. 
This year, to improve transparency, we have structured the report as follows: 
	.	p30  Introduction from the Chairman  
	.	p31  Our corporate governance framework  
p31 Corporate governance highlights p33 Audit Committee Report 
	.	p37  Corporate Responsibility Committee Report  
	.	p38  Nominations Committee Report  
	.	p39  Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code  
Introduction from the Chairman 
This section of our Report sets out how we manage Tesco to ensure as far as possible that the values you would expect us to operate by are in place and adhered to, that commercial and operational risks are identified and controlled, that we have strategies and plans in place to optimise shareholder value over an appropriate time period and that a proper system of checks and balances is in place without inhibiting the efficient running of the Company. 
Our approach to governance remains unchanged. It begins with the recognition that governance is not simply a set of rules but the framework supporting core values which define what is and what is not acceptable. It is an expression of the way we want to conduct ourselves which informs actions and decisions whether or not there is a specific rule for the situation, and which supports the culture and behaviours that we wish to foster. 
I remarked last year that the governance framework, and perhaps more importantly the corporate culture and human relationships that underpin all governance frameworks, are operating as we hoped and that we felt that further material changes were unlikely. I am glad to confirm this assessment and consequently there are few new developments to report as the changes I reported on this time last year have settled in and the Board has focused on its task of balancing the short-term competitive and economic pressures with the need to invest to ensure the business is a leader in the world of multichannel retailing. 
The Board itself has evolved substantially over the past two years from its historical structure of broadly balanced Executive and Non-executive representation to its current shape of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer being the only Executive members of the Board. It is important to view these changes in the context of management development generally and in particular the development of a strong Executive Committee under Philip Clarke, the individual members of which generally attend Board discussions of matters reflecting their responsibilities. This allows the Board to operate as a smaller group, supporting real, robust and penetrating debate while ensuring continued contact with a range of senior business executives. 
Board structure is not set in stone. At any point in time it must reflect the requirements and state of development of the business in order to be effective. The Tesco Board will continue to evolve to best match the needs of the business.

Our corporate governance framework 
Board 
Executive Committee 
* Meets when required 
The work of the Board is supported by five key Committees: the Audit, Corporate Responsibility, Nominations, Remuneration and Disclosure Committees. 
The role of the Disclosure Committee includes to assist and inform the Board in making decisions concerning the identification of inside information and make recommendations about how and when the Company should disclose the information in accordance with the Company’s Disclosure Policy. The Committee meets as necessary to consider all relevant matters relating to inside information. It will in particular meet in advance of the release of all trading statements and other announcements of inside information to ensure that they are true, accurate and complete. The Committee met 11 times during the year. 
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found at www.tescoplc.com. The Group Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’) chairs the meetings. Other members of the Committee consist of relevant senior management and Executive Committee members. 
Further details on the other Board Committees can be found on pages 33 to 36 (Audit); 37 (Corporate Responsibility); 38 (Nominations); and 41 to 61 (Remuneration). All the Committees report back to the Board after each meeting. 
The Board delegates to the Group Chief Executive (‘CEO’) the responsibility for formulating and, after approval, implementing the Group’s strategic plan and for management of the day-to-day operations of the Group. 
The Group Executive Committee, which the CEO chairs, supports the CEO in carrying out his role and manages the day-to-day operations of the Group’s business. The Group Executive Committee comprises the CEO and CFO and a number of senior executives. The Group Executive Committee has established a number of sub-committees which assist in its work and ensure: 
• Strategic choices are properly considered • New growth opportunities are fully discussed • Progress against the Group’s priorities is reviewed 
The membership of the sub-committees comprises a mix of Group Executive Committee members and senior management from relevant functions. The sub-committees report to the Group Executive Committee after each meeting on their work and issues are escalated for discussion and/or decision to the Group Executive Committee or the Board as appropriate. 
Corporate governance highlights 
Board focus during the year 
During the year the Board spent its time considering a wide range of matters. These included: 
• Strategy • Performance overall and of individual businesses and 
functions in the Group • Budgets and long-term plans for the Group • Financial statements and announcements • Reviewing reports from its Committees, notably on 
management development, succession and remuneration • Corporate and social responsibility • Pensions • Health and safety • Shareholder feedback and reports from brokers and analysts • Risk management and controls in the Group • Delegated authorities 
The Board also had two offsite meetings dedicated to strategy. 
In addition to its regular programme of activities, the Board made a number of strategic decisions in the year, which included: 
• Divestment of the US-based Fresh & Easy business to Yucaipa • Entry into a joint venture with China Resources Enterprise 
Limited in China • Entry into a joint venture with Tata Group in India • Acquisition of 100% of the restaurant group Giraffe in the UK 
Changes to the Board 
The Board was pleased to announce the appointment of two new Non-executive Directors during the year. Olivia Garfield joined the Board on 1 April 2013 and Mark Armour joined on 2 September 2013. Both Olivia and Mark bring a wealth of skills and experience to the Board which are detailed in their biographies on page 26. Laurie Mcllwee, Group CFO stepped down from the Board as an Executive Director on 4 April 2014. The Board is commencing a process to find a new Group CFO. We do not anticipate further substantial changes to the size of the Board in the foreseeable future, although, as noted in the Chairman’s introduction, the number of Directors may change with the normal process of Board development.

Board evaluation 
This year the Board evaluation was conducted internally and led by the Chairman with the support of the Company Secretary. The Senior Independent Director (‘SID’) led the review of the Chairman’s performance. The evaluation combined the use of a questionnaire completed by each Board member and in-depth interviews with each of the Directors. The scope of the review covered a range of factors relevant to the effectiveness of the Board, including the balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Board, its diversity and how the Board works together as a unit. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, the Board last conducted an externally facilitated Board evaluation in 2011/2012, which was facilitated by Egon Zehnder. The intention is to continue with the three-year cycle whereby the Board will conduct an externally led review in one year, followed by internally led reviews in the subsequent two years, one led by the SID and one led by the Chairman. 
Board meetings 
Last year the Board moved to a pattern of six formal meetings annually, plus a strategy meeting and ad hoc meetings were also arranged to deal with matters between scheduled meetings as appropriate. Board meetings were preceded by a day of Committee meetings and by a dinner the previous evening. Board meetings themselves lasted the majority of the day in most cases. This pattern of meetings was intended to support the Board’s focus on strategic and long-term matters, while ensuring it could discharge its monitoring and oversight role effectively through intensive high-quality discussions and high-quality information flows. The effectiveness of this approach was reviewed at the end of last year and the Board will plan to have seven formal meetings annually henceforth.

Ken Hanna 
Audit Committee Chairman 
* Appointed to the Audit Committee on 2 October 2013 
The Audit Committee has an integral role in providing confidence in the integrity of the Company’s processes and procedures in relation to internal control, risk management and corporate reporting. The Committee’s role continues to be increasingly challenging due to the changes and uncertainty in the regulatory, economic and political environment in which the business operates. 
This year, pursuant to the new requirements under the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) the Committee was requested by the Board to support it in assessing whether the report and accounts were fair, balanced and understandable and provide sufficient information to allow an assessment of the Company. The Code also required new specific disclosures to be made on the work of the Committee, including significant issues which it has considered in relation to the financial statements and how these have been addressed. 
During the year the Committee was pleased to welcome Mark Armour as a member. He brings with him a wealth of financial and wider experience gained over many years in business. The Committee is also pleased to welcome Olivia Garfield as a member with effect from 1 April 2014.

Corporate governance report continued 
Activities during the year 
During the year the Committee received update reports from a number of businesses, including Tesco Bank, and also from the Disclosure Committee and Compliance Committee. It also received updates from Internal Audit on its work, including findings from its internal audit programme. The Committee considered a variety of matters including the Group Finance Risk Register; fraud, bribery and corruption; business continuity management; the Grocery Supply Chain Compliance Code; whistleblowing arrangements; and non-audit fees. 
In relation to the financial statements the Committee: reviewed and recommended approval of the half-yearly results and annual financial statements; conducted impairment reviews; reviewed and recommended dividend levels; reviewed corporate governance disclosures and monitored the statutory audit. The Committee also advised the Board on whether the financial statements, taken as a whole, were fair, balanced and understandable and provide the necessary information to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. 
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of the external audit process by means of a detailed questionnaire completed by key stakeholders, including the Board, the Executive Committee, 
members of senior management and Internal Audit. The questionnaire assessed external audit in the following areas: qualification; expertise and resources; operational effectiveness; independence and leadership. The results are rated against an ideal standard and compared to prior years to assess the consistency of performance. 
The effectiveness of the Internal Audit function was assessed by means of a detailed questionnaire which was also completed by key stakeholders. The assessment covered the Internal Audit function’s understanding of its role and responsibility, its charter, the quality of its communications, its performance and the skills and expertise of the team. 
The Committee carried out a review of its effectiveness during the year via the Committee Chairman conducting interviews with key stakeholders and the use of a questionnaire. The Committee concluded that it continues to be effective and has sufficient resources to carry out its duties. 
The Committee considered a number of significant issues in the year taking into account in all instances the views of the Company’s external auditors. The issues and how they were addressed by the Committee are detailed below: 
Significant financial statement reporting issues 
Issue 
How the issue was addressed by the Committee 
Going concern basis for the financial statements 
The Committee reviewed management’s assessment of going concern with consideration of forecast cash flows, including sensitivity to trading and expenditure plans and potential mitigating actions. The Committee also considered the availability of financing facilities and the capital and liquidity plans of Tesco Bank. Based on this the Committee confirmed that the application of the going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements continued to be appropriate. 
Fixed asset impairment 
The Committee assessed management’s impairment testing of property assets, considering the appropriateness of key assumptions and methodologies for both value in use models and fair value measurements. This included review of cashflows, growth rates and discount rates and the use of independent third party valuers. The Group has recognised a £(734)m charge for the impairment of European stores in the year. 
China disposal group valuation 
The China disposal group is measured at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell. The Committee considered the methodology and assumptions used in the valuation including review of cashflows, growth rates and discount rates used, valuation multiples for similar transactions and companies and the appropriate level of synergies to include in the valuation. As part of this procedure, the Committee met with the independent expert valuers engaged by management to assist in the valuation process. A £(540)m write-down to fair value less costs to sell was recognised at year end. See Note 7 to the financial statements. 
Goodwill impairment 
The Committee reviewed management’s process for testing goodwill for potential impairment. This review included consideration of key assumptions, principally cash flow forecasts, long-term growth rates and discount rates. The Committee concurred with management's judgement that no impairment was required. See Note 10 to the financial statements, ‘Goodwill and other intangible assets’ for more details. 
Tesco Bank judgemental matters 
The Committee reviewed management’s judgements made in relation to Tesco Bank’s provisions for customer redress, loan impairment provisions and insurance reserves. The Committee received detailed reports from management regarding these judgements and interfaced directly with the Bank’s own audit committee and board to develop a detailed understanding of the matters. During the year, an additional £(63)m of provisions for customer redress were recognised. See Note 24 of the financial statements. 
Income statement non-GAAP measure presentation 
The Committee considered the presentation of the Group financial statements and, in particular, the appropriateness of the presentation of one-off items in the calculation of underlying profit in light of the latest FRC guidance on the matter. It reviewed the nature of items identified and whether treatment was even-handed, consistent across years and appropriately presented movements on items which have an effect over a number of years. The total restructuring and other one-off charge for the year was £(801)m. 
The Committee notes that commercial income was an area of focus for the external auditors based on their assessment of gross risks. It is the Committee’s view that whilst commercial income is a significant income for the Group and involves an element of judgement, management operates an appropriate control environment which minimises risks in this area. As a result, the Committee does not consider that this is a significant issue for disclosure in its report. 

34 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Training 
The Committee continually assesses the need for training and the annual agenda provides substantial time for technical updates which are generally provided by external experts. During the year, training was provided on corporate governance developments and accounting and tax developments. Training is also provided on an ongoing basis to meet the specific needs of individual Committee members. 
Internal and External Audit 
It is essential for the Committee to be able to have an honest and open relationship with both its external and internal auditors. This relationship is developed and maintained through regular private meetings with both PwC and the Head of Internal Audit. Further information regarding the roles of both Internal Audit and External Audit can be found below. 
Internal Audit 
The Internal Audit function is independent of business operations and has a Group-wide mandate. It undertakes a continuous programme to review the internal control and risk management processes with particular reference to the Code. It operates a risk-based methodology, ensuring that the Group’s key risks receive appropriate examination each year. Its responsibilities include: 
	•	Maintaining the Group Key Risk Register  
	•	Facilitating oversight of risk management arrangements  across the Group through structured reviews with senior management teams in the UK, Europe and Asia covering our operating businesses and joint ventures  
	•	Using the results of these reviews to assist the Executive Committee to refresh and update the Group Key Risk Register  
	•	Reviewing and reporting on the effectiveness of risk management systems and internal controls to senior management, the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee and ultimately to the Board  
External Audit 
The Company’s external auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) contribute a further independent perspective on certain aspects of the Company’s financial control systems arising from its work, and report both to the Board and the Audit Committee. 
PwC have served as the Company’s auditor since 1983 and the last audit tender was carried out in that year. The partner engaged on the audit is changed regularly. The current partner is due to rotate after the year ended February 2017. The Audit Committee keeps under review the ongoing legislative proposals on audit tendering and rotation from the EU and the Competition Commission, now the Competition and Markets Authority, and will implement them in accordance with the suggested timescales. 
The engagement and independence of PwC is considered annually by the Audit Committee before it recommends its selection to the Board. The Committee is satisfied that PwC remain independent and are best placed to conduct the Company’s audit for 2014/2015. The Committee therefore recommends that PwC be reappointed as auditors. 
The Company has a Non-audit Service Policy for work carried out by PwC. This is split into three categories as explained below: 
• Pre-approved work for external auditors – this is predominantly the audit of subsidiary undertakings’ statutory accounts and is audit-related in nature 
• Work for which Committee approval is specifically required – this includes transaction work and corporate tax services, and certain advisory services 
• Work from which the external auditor is prohibited 
  
Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 35 
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 
Corporate governance report continued 
To safeguard auditor objectivity and independence the Committee oversees the process for the approval of all non-audit services provided by PwC. Prior to approval, consideration is given to whether it is in the interests of the Company that the services are purchased from PwC, rather than another supplier. 
This year the Committee approved PwC to complete £1.2m of audit-related services. These services principally related to the audit of the accounts of the Tesco China business in relation to the preparation of the China Resources Enterprise Limited (‘CRE’) 
shareholder circular required to approve the formation of our joint venture. PwC were best placed to conduct this work as they had previously conducted the audit work for Tesco and were fully aware of the history of our business in China. 
Where any significant non-audit related work is required (fee value £300k), the pre-approval of the Committee is specifically required. In total £4.7m (2013: £2.9m) was spent on non-audit fees (being 46% of the total spent with our external auditors) and details of the significant items are shown in the table below: 
Business area 
Work undertaken 
Rationale for use of PwC 
Amount 
Group 
PwC carried out due diligence work related to the CRE transaction in China. 
PwC’s detailed knowledge and understanding of our business and retailing in China meant they were uniquely placed to assist us in this key task. The Committee considered the proposal carefully to ensure that the independence of the due diligence team from the ongoing audit relationship was preserved. 
£1.8m 
UK 
PwC carried out consultancy work in the UK around organisational development. 
PwC were evaluated against other potential consultants for this work and won the engagement based on the quality of their service offering. Their role was one of facilitation. All reorganisation design decisions were taken by management. 
£1.2m 
UK, Europe and Asia 
In Asia PwC carried out tax consultancy principally related to the tax implications of the CRE transaction in China and legislative compliance in South Korea; and, in Europe and the UK, the advice centred around compliance with VAT regulations. 
PwC’s understanding of the structure of our business ensured that they were well placed to carry out this work cost effectively. 
£0.6m 
The fees paid to the auditors in the year are disclosed in Note 3 of the

Corporate Responsibility Committee Report 
Sir Richard Broadbent 
Corporate Responsibility Committee Chairman 
Corporate responsibility is an integral part of how our business operates. It reflects the inescapable reality that if the values of a business fail to resonate with the values of society, it is endangering long-term prosperity. Tesco is committed to identifying and living the values which are important to our colleagues and customers and the Corporate Responsibility Committee provides a forum to ensure the Board gives adequate attention to this. 
Last year we introduced a new Value: we use our scale for good, and during the year we have made considerable progress in embedding that Value into our business. Some of the highlights of our work are described below. The full ambit of the Committee’s work can be gauged by reading the Tesco and Society Report 2014 which accompanies our Annual Report and Financial Statements. 
After chairing the Committee for the last two years it has been agreed that I should rotate off as the Chairman of the Committee and that Jacqueline Tammenoms Bakker would take over the chair with effect from 1 March 2014. 
Sir Richard Broadbent 
Corporate Responsibility Committee Chairman 
Corporate Responsibility Committee responsibilities 
The Corporate Responsibility Committee was established in 2012 to ensure that the Board maintains an adequate focus on corporate responsibility in its widest sense. The Committee’s terms of reference are available at www.tescoplc.com. 
The key responsibilities of the Committee are to: 
	•	Define the Group’s corporate and social obligations as a responsible citizen and oversee its conduct in the context of those obligations  
	•	Approve a strategy for discharging the Group’s corporate and social responsibilities in such a way as to command respect and confidence  
• Identify and monitor those external developments which are likely to have a significant influence on the Group’s reputation and/or its ability to conduct its business appropriately as a good citizen and review how best to protect that reputation or that ability 
• Oversee the creation of appropriate policies and supporting measures 
• Monitor the Group’s engagement with external stakeholders and other interested parties 
• Ensure that appropriate communications policies are in place and working effectively to build and protect the Group’s reputation both internally and externally 
Activities during the year 
Last year we introduced a new core purpose: we make what matters better, together. We also articulated a new Value to help us achieve our core purpose: we use our scale for good. It’s based on the recognition that by using our skills and scale, we can make a significant contribution to major challenges facing society. 
We chose to take a lead in tackling three challenges which were particularly relevant to us as a large global retailer and are important to our colleagues, customers and communities. 
Our three big ambitions are: 
• To lead in reducing food waste globally • To improve health and through this help to tackle the global 
obesity crisis • To create new opportunities for millions of people around 
the world 
These three ambitions build on our essential responsibilities as a good corporate citizen – in terms of trading responsibly, reducing our impact on the environment, being a great employer and supporting local communities. 
Over the last 12 months we’ve worked hard to embed our new Value through the business. We want to help deliver significant, long-term change and so our focus has been on examining the problems and developing clear and focused plans of action: insight-to-action. We have engaged with experts in the different areas. We have held roundtable discussions on a range of subjects including health, young people, food sourcing and food waste. 
In tackling food waste we have published our own operations waste data which has been independently assured by KPMG. We have also developed profiles of some of our most frequently purchased products showing where most food waste occurs in the value chain from farm to fork. Identifying these hotspots means that we can focus our action plans where we can make the biggest difference. In improving health, our new Healthy Little Differences Tracker will map the health profile of our customers’ shopping trips over time. In providing opportunities, we have carried out extensive research with young people to find out their ambitions, the challenges they face and the support that they need. 
During the year, the Committee was updated on the progress made on our three big ambitions and discussed the performance measures for this work. The Committee was briefed on the development of an advisory panel which would share views and insights from outside the business, look at best practice and emerging trends, challenge current thinking and collaborate to help find solutions. The Committee also discussed the results of the latest research on reputation.

Corporate governance report continued 
Nominations Committee Report 
Activities during the year 
The Committee divides its time broadly between reviewing executive management development and succession planning; and reviewing Board development and governance matters. 
This year the Committee discussed the progress which had been made on culture and capability in the past 24 months, including rolling out new leadership skills and developing the capability of business leaders, and advancements in succession planning and diversity. 
The Committee also reviewed succession planning for senior roles and the management development programmes which are in place to ensure adequate bench strength and appropriate skills are developed across the business. 
With regard to Board development and governance, the Committee identified and recommended two appointments to the Board. Olivia Garfield joined the Board as a Non-executive Director on 1 April 2013 and Mark Armour joined the Board as a Non-executive Director on 2 September 2013. Both Olivia and Mark bring a wealth of skills and experience to the Board which are detailed in their biographies on page 26. 
The Committee considers a number of factors when making new appointments, including what the new Director will add to the balance of skills and experience on the Board, and whether the Director will be able to allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge his or her responsibilities. We worked with the external search consultancy Lygon Group, which does not have any connection with the Company, as well as using our own networks, to identify candidates. 
The Committee also considered a number of changes to the composition of the Board’s Committees to ensure appropriate balance and succession potential. These are detailed on page 32. 
In addition, the Committee reviewed the key themes which had emerged from governance meetings with shareholders in the run-up to the AGM and agreed the proposed approach for this year’s Board evaluation to recommend to the Board. 
Diversity 
Tesco approaches diversity in its broadest sense, recognising that successful world-class businesses flourish through embracing intellectual, experiential, geographical and skills diversity as well as other factors such as age, disability, gender, race and sexual orientation. With regard to gender diversity, which is the focus of significant current attention, we accept the spirit and aspirations of the Davies Report, including the representation of women at the highest levels in the organisation. 
There are currently three women on our Board (27%), three women on the Executive Committee (19%) and women in senior management positions across the Group account for 30% as a whole. We believe that the focus must remain firmly on understanding what it takes to develop women and to retain them in senior positions. Senior roles are very demanding for all, regardless of gender, and we are determined to develop a culture and an environment where our people can advance whilst having the time to be good parents, partners and active members of their local community. 
Our policy is to find, develop and keep a diverse workforce at all levels within our Company and we are committed to increasing the percentage of female leaders. We set a target in September 2011 for women to represent 32% of senior management and 20% of business leaders and Directors. We are close to our target with 30% of senior managers and we have exceeded our target with 22% of business leaders and Directors being women. 

Sir Richard Broadbent 
Nominations Committee Chairman 
The Nominations Committee divides its time broadly between reviewing executive bench strength and succession and overseeing Board succession and governance. The year was marked by a continued focus on executive bench strength and succession reflecting the priority being given to building talent development and succession options at all levels. The Committee also devoted time to reviewing Board development over the short and medium term. 
The Group CEO and Group Personnel Director are regular attendees at Committee meetings which provide a valuable opportunity for in-depth and candid discussion in a small group on human and governance issues. 
Sir Richard Broadbent

38 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) sets out principles and specific provisions on how a company should be directed and controlled to achieve standards of good corporate governance. In September 2012 the Financial Reporting Council made changes to the Code which focused on reporting. The 2012 version of the Code applies to the Company for the year ended 22 February 2014. A copy of the Code is available at www.frc.org.uk. 
The Board considers that the Company complied in all material respects with the Code for the whole of the year ended 22 February 2014 except with regards to Code provision E.2.3, as Ken Hanna was unable to attend the AGM due to a long-standing prior engagement. Also, with regard to the new Code provision C.3.7, which requires external audit contracts to be put out to tender at least every ten years, the Company has not re-tendered within that period, but the Audit Committee keeps under review the ongoing legislative proposals on audit tendering and rotation from the EU and the Competition Commission, now the Competition and Markets Authority, and will implement them in accordance with the suggested timescales. Further details are provided on page 35. 
The notes below are intended to facilitate the assessment of the Company’s compliance with the Code for the year ended 22 February 2014 but they should be read in conjunction with the Corporate Governance Report as a whole. 

A. Leadership 

B. Effectiveness 
A.1 The Board’s role 
The Board is the custodian of the Company’s values and of its long-term vision, and provides strategic direction and guidance for the Company. The matters reserved to the Board for its decisions are detailed in a formal schedule. Matters which must be considered by the Board include: the Group’s strategy; annual budgets; oversight of risk management processes; changes to the capital structure; and material transactions or litigation. 
The Board held six scheduled meetings in the year ended 22 February 2014 and ad hoc meetings were also arranged to deal with matters between scheduled meetings as appropriate. It is expected that all Directors attend scheduled Board and relevant Committee meetings and the Annual General Meeting. Details of Board and Committee membership and attendance can be found on pages 32 and 33, 37 
and 38. 
All Directors are covered by the Group’s Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance policy. 
A.2 A clear division of responsibilities 
There is a clear delineation between the role of the Chairman and CEO. Their role descriptions were agreed by the Board in 2012 and are summarised below: 
Chairman’s responsibilities: 
Ensuring the Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information Facilitating the effective contribution of Non-executive Directors and engagement between Executive and Non-executive Directors Ensuring an annual evaluation of the Board is conducted and leading the performance evaluation of the CEO and Non-executive Directors, plus ensuring that the Committee Chairmen conduct evaluations of their Committees Building an effective Board The induction of new Directors and further training for all Directors as required Communicating effectively with shareholders and other stakeholders and ensuring the Board develops an understanding of the view of the stakeholders 
Group CEO’s responsibilities: 
Leading the development of the Company’s strategic direction and implementing the agreed strategy Identifying and executing new business opportunities Managing the Group’s risk profile and implementing and maintaining an effective framework of internal controls 
Building and maintaining an effective top management team Ensuring effective communication with shareholders and key stakeholders and regularly updating institutional shareholders on the business strategy and performance 
A.3 Role of the Chairman 
The Chairman was independent upon his appointment to the Board. He leads the Board, ensuring its effectiveness while taking account of the interests of the Group’s various stakeholders, and promoting high standards of corporate governance. 
A.4 Non-executive Directors 
Patrick Cescau was the Senior Independent Director (‘SID’) throughout the year ending 22 February 2014. Patrick was selected in July 2010 for the role because of his experience and expertise, both as an Executive and Non-executive Director. A biography is available on page 26. In his role as SID, Patrick Cescau is available to assist in resolving shareholder concerns should alternative channels be exhausted. The SID’s role also includes responsibility for the Chairman’s appraisal and succession; and to hold at least one meeting each year with the Non-executive Directors without the Chairman present. 
The Chairman also has one-to-one and group meetings with the Non-executive Directors without the Executive Directors being present. 
During the year, there were no unresolved concerns about the running of the Company or a proposed action. 

B.1 The Board’s composition 
Last year the Board was intentionally managed to a smaller size with proportionally greater Non-executive representation relative to Executive. 
The Board reviewed the overall balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Board and Committee members and a number of changes were made to the Non-executive representation as detailed on pages 31 and 32. 
During the year the Board comprised of the Non-executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and eight Non-executive Directors. All the Non-executive Directors are considered to be independent under the criteria set out in the Code. 
B.2 Board appointments 
The appointment of new Directors is led by the Nominations Committee. Further details of the appointments process can be found in the Nominations Committee section on page 38 and biographies of our Directors can be found on pages 26 and 27. 
B.3 Time commitments 
The Board makes a careful assessment of the time commitments required from the Chairman and Non-executive Directors to discharge their roles properly. This is discussed with candidates as part of the recruitment process and a commitment to the appropriate time requirements is included in their engagement letter. 
B.4 Training and development 
All new Directors receive a personalised induction programme, tailored to their experience, background and particular area of focus, which is designed to develop their knowledge and understanding of the Group’s culture and operations. The programme has evolved over time to take into account feedback from new Directors and the development of best practice and incorporates a wide-ranging programme of meetings with the senior management across the Group, attending results and broker briefings, comprehensive briefing materials and opportunities to visit the Group’s operations across the world including spending time in-store and in our distribution network. The Chairman agrees a personalised induction plan with each new Director and ensures that it meets the individual needs of that Director. 
The Chairman reviews each Director’s development needs as part of the annual performance evaluation process and puts appropriate arrangements in place for specific training. The Nominations Committee reviews the Directors’ skills and experience as a group against those needed to continue to enable the Board to oversee and support the Group’s diverse operations in the future and identifies any gaps. This informs the approach to ongoing refreshment of the Board as well as the training plan for the current Board. Training is arranged to help develop the knowledge and skills of the Directors in 
a variety of areas relevant to the Group’s business. All Directors have the opportunity to refresh and increase their knowledge of the Group through visits to Group Operations and meeting with senior executives across the business. 
B.5 Provision of information and support 
Board papers are circulated a week before each meeting to give the Directors and Committee members sufficient time to fully consider the information. 
All Directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary and may take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in conducting their duties. 
B.6 Board and committee performance evaluation 
During the year the Board undertook a thorough review of its performance and that of its Committees and individual Directors. Further information can be found on page 32. 
B.7 Re-election of Directors 
All Directors were subject to shareholder re-election at the 2013 AGM and this will be the case at the 2014 AGM. 
Information about the Directors can be found in their biographies on pages 26 and 27.

C. Accountability 

Whilst no internal control system can guarantee that losses will not occur, the Board is satisfied that management have remained diligent in their efforts to ensure that an appropriate level of control remains in place. 
C.3 Role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee supports the Board in its responsibilities in relation to corporate reporting and risk management and internal controls, and with maintaining a relationship with the Company’s auditors. 
The Audit Committee’s report on pages 33 to 36 sets out a description of the work of the Committee. 
D. Remuneration 
C.1 Financial and business reporting 
The Directors’ statement of responsibilities for the preparation of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 can be found on page 64. Information on the Company’s business model can be found on pages 10 and 11 and its strategy can be found on pages 3 to 7. 
The Directors’ confirmation that the business is a going concern can be found on page 63. 
C.2 Risk management and internal control systems 
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring the Group has appropriate risk management and internal controls in place and that they continue to work effectively. 
There is a comprehensive process for the review and consideration of risk at Tesco. Risk Registers are in place for all businesses and some key Group functions also maintain a specific Risk Register. The Group also maintain a Group Key Risk Register which describes key risks faced by the Group and their likelihood and impact, as well as the controls and procedures implemented to mitigate them. Group risks are determined by discussion with senior management and are reviewed by the Group Executive Committee and then agreed by the Board. 
In addition to reviewing the Group Risk Register, the Board carries out in-depth reviews of key risk areas each year. 
The Company maintains a comprehensive framework of internal controls addressing the key strategic, financial, legal, reputational and operational risks to the business and the accountability for operating these controls rests with senior management as a first line of defence. 
Colleagues are required to confirm annually that they complied with the Code of Business Conduct which sets out individual obligations and responsibilities for anyone working at Tesco. 
Group Finance is responsible for preparing the Group’s financial statements. Last year it took steps to make the processes more robust by developing a key financial control framework to describe a mandatory suite of controls across key business processes. Compliance is monitored by an annual self-assessment. 
A number of key management committees play a role in monitoring compliance with internal controls. The Group Compliance Committee is responsible for monitoring legal compliance across the Group, including receiving reports from the individual business unit compliance committees. 
The Audit Committee reports each year on its assessment of the effectiveness of the risk management and internal controls systems. Throughout the year the Committee receives regular reports from the external auditor covering topics such as quality of earnings and technical accounting developments. Internal Audit and senior management also regularly provide updates to the Committee and any significant breaches of control, together with the appropriate remediation arrangements are discussed. 
The Board conducted a review of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal controls during the year. To support the Board in their annual assessment, a summary report is prepared which describes the arrangements that the Board has put in place for internal control and risk management systems and summarises the key issues or non-compliances arising from those processes. 
These arrangements include: 
	1.	The Annual Risk Management Process (as described in the principal risks and uncertainties section on pages 20 to 25) – there is a comprehensive process for the review and consideration of risk at Tesco. Risk Registers are in place for all Business Units and for some key Group Functions, including Group Finance. These are considered regularly by subsidiary boards to assess their control systems and have all been reviewed at least once in the last year. The Group Key Risk Register was reviewed by the Executive Committee in January 2014 and the Board in February 2014. During the reviews all the Group risks were challenged and refreshed.  
	2.	The Internal Audit Programme – a risk-based programme of Internal Audit is conducted annually and the findings of those audits, together with the monitoring of the progress of management’s remediation programmes is reviewed by the Board.  
	3.	Evaluation of the Control Findings from External Audit – PwC are not a part of Tesco’s internal control system. However, they do form an assessment on the financial control environment as they conduct their audit work and this is another point of reference and information for the Board and senior management to consider on the operation of our controls.  
	4.	Assessment of Compliance Activities at a Group and Business Unit Level – the results of a number of other key compliance activities are also considered during the review of the effectiveness of risk management and internal control arrangements. These include: the outputs from the Group and Business Unit Compliance Committee processes; the returns from the Annual Code of Business Conduct declaration process; the results of the Key Financial Controls Self-Assessment process; the results of store-based compliance reviews of stock, cash and price integrity processes; the results of the Group Technical and Trading Law assessments including ethical audits; the outputs from the Tesco Bank Risk Assurance and Compliance process; reports from the Fraud and Code of Conduct Investigations; and, the results from the Information Security reviews and incidents that occurred in the year.  

D.1 Level and elements of remuneration 
The Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 41 to 61 explains the level of remuneration received by the Directors and how the Company has aligned the remuneration received to corporate and individual performance. 
D.2 Development of remuneration policy 
The development of our remuneration policy and our rationale for the level and structure of the remuneration for our senior management is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 61. 
E. Relations with shareholders 
E.1 Shareholder engagement 
We are committed to conducting constructive dialogue with shareholders to ensure that we understand what is important to them and enable clear communication of our position. The Chairman, CEO and CFO hold regular meetings with shareholders and update the Board on the outcome of those meetings. Investor Relations 
keep the Board informed of broker and analyst views and report and present formally to the Board twice a year. In addition we carry out a survey each year of a cross-section of shareholders in order to assess shareholder perception of the Company. 
We support greater engagement with institutional shareholders as envisaged by the Stewardship Code. We are also keen to develop engagement with private shareholders through various channels of communication, including the AGM, the Company’s website and social media. 
E.2 Constructive use of the AGM 
Our 2014 AGM will be held in London on 27 June 2014. The whole Board is expected to attend the AGM and be available to answer questions from shareholders present. 
In 2013 Ken Hanna was unable to attend the AGM due to a long-standing prior engagement. All other Directors were present and talked to a number of shareholders before and after the meeting. 
To encourage shareholder participation, we offer electronic proxy voting and voting through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service. At our AGM all resolutions are proposed and voted upon individually by shareholders or their proxies. All votes taken during the AGM are by way of electronic poll. This follows best practice guidelines and allows the Company to count all votes, not just those of shareholders attending the meeting.

New remuneration reporting framework 
Subject to an advisory vote at the 2014 AGM 
Subject to a binding vote at the 2014 AGM 
Despite strong progress against strategic objectives during the year and the exceptional effort management have put in to achieve this, the bonus profit underpin was not met and therefore the Executive Directors will not receive a bonus in respect of 2013/14. 
Performance Share Plan awards granted in 2011 will lapse in July 2014 as challenging three-year EPS and ROCE targets were not met. 
Reward changes for 2014/15 
No changes are being made to our reward framework in 2014/15. 
Board changes 
Laurie McIlwee resigned as CFO and as an Executive Director of Tesco PLC on 4 April 2014. Laurie remains an employee of Tesco and, for a period of six months from 4 April 2014, will be employed as CFO Emeritus performing transition activities and supporting handover with colleagues as we recruit a replacement CFO. Details of Laurie’s leaving arrangements are set out on page 51. 
Review of remuneration arrangements for 2015/16 and beyond The world of retail is evolving rapidly as customers embrace technology to help them shop in different ways, and Tesco is changing to make the most of the opportunities this presents. To ensure that we continue to operate a remuneration framework which reflects this rapidly changing market, is fully aligned with our strategy and provides competitive rewards to management for the creation of shareholder value, the Committee plans to undertake a review of executive remuneration during 2014/15. We will consult with shareholders in relation to any changes we would propose to make, and it is anticipated that we will bring a revised remuneration approach to shareholders at the 2015 AGM. 
Stuart Chambers 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
     
The new remuneration reporting regulations came into force on 1 October 2013 and apply to Tesco for the 2013/14 financial year. To reflect this, the Committee has restructured the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 2013/14 and split it into two parts. 
The Policy Report will be submitted to shareholders for a binding vote for the first time at the 2014 AGM and the policy will be effective from that date. The Annual Remuneration Report will also be submitted to shareholders for an advisory vote at the same meeting. The Committee hopes that the new form of report is clear and informative and would welcome feedback from shareholders. 
Incentive payouts for 2013/14 
In 2013/14 we shifted our focus from addressing existing business issues to driving our strategy for future growth. The progress we have made to date in Building a Better Tesco has strengthened our business’s foundations, positioning the Company to create value for our shareholders. Our store refresh programme continues, where we are updating our stores to make them more contemporary, improving the shopping environment and making them more compelling for our customers. We are now accelerating our growth in new channels and investing in sharper prices, improved quality, stronger ranges and better service. The area where change has been most significant however is in the acceleration of the development of our multichannel strategy, evolving our offering as the way customers shop evolves. 
Management have been working hard to deliver this business transformation, making difficult decisions today to position Tesco to be the leading retailer of tomorrow. This strategy is starting to yield results: Group internet sales increased by 15% and we are getting better feedback from customers and colleagues across the Group.

The following report outlines our remuneration strategy and philosophy, how remuneration policy was implemented in 2013/14 and how the Committee intends to apply policy in 2014/15. This Annual Remuneration Report will be submitted to an advisory shareholder vote at the AGM on 27 June 2014. 
Remuneration strategy 
Tesco’s most important asset is its people. Business success depends on the performance and contribution of each individual colleague but outstanding performance comes from teamwork. Our approach to remuneration throughout Tesco is guided by a framework of common objectives and principles which are outlined in the table below.

	•	We reward in a responsible way  
Linking executive pay with strategy 
• Alignment with strategy Our strategic focus is to build a stronger business that is sustainable and equipped to compete in the future. The majority of our reward is linked to the delivery of stretching performance over the short and long term aligned with the achievement of our business vision and our strategy (see the Report from the Chief Executive on pages 3 to 7). The majority of reward is delivered in shares. Our short-term performance is measured in relation to profit growth and the delivery of other strategic financial and non-financial objectives. Our long-term performance is measured by assessing the growth in our earnings per share and the level of our return on capital. These metrics are a key measure of the success of the delivery of shareholder value. 
• Simple, collegiate approach to remuneration Our remuneration arrangements are designed to be simple to provide clarity to our Executives and to shareholders. Executive Directors and other management participate in a common incentive framework to ensure teamwork in delivering our key strategic goals. 
• Creating alignment with shareholders by building a shareholding in our business We believe that it is important that our colleagues are shareholders in the business to create alignment with other shareholders. The CEO’s shareholding guideline is to hold shares with a value of four times salary, the CFO is required to hold shares with a value of three times salary and other senior managers are required to hold shares with a value of one times salary. 
The following chart and accompanying table provide a summary of how remuneration policy will be applied in 2014/15.

How do performance measures link to strategy? 
The balance of short-term performance measures is illustrated in the chart below: 
Short-term performance 
Performance measure 
Link to strategy 
Profitability (50% of short-term) 
• Tradingprofit 
The profit measure incentivises the delivery of our strategy by encouraging the creation of shareholder value through bottom-line financial results. Trading profit is used as it is widely understood throughout the business, and does not include property profits. This reflects our fundamentally different approach to space going forward. 
Strategic financial performance (26% of short-term) 
	•	Group internet sales (10%)  
	•	UK like-for-like sales (8%)  • Groupworkingcapital(8%)  
The selected strategic financial measures allow for the Company to more specifically incentivise the delivery of key elements of our strategy. 
Establishing multichannel leadership is an important and exciting dimension of our strategy and continues to be a key focus for 2014/15. 
Another key priority for 2014/15 is delivering on our commitments to continue to invest in a strong UK business. A focus on improving like-for-like performance will support this. 
A working capital metric is included to focus Executives on the effective management of stock, cash and suppliers. 
Strategic non-financial performance (24% of short-term) • Groupcustomerservice(8%) • Groupcolleagueengagement(8%) • Group CO2 reduction (8%) 
At Tesco we believe that a focus on the enablers of business performance will help us build a much more successful, sustainable business for the long term which will ultimately yield financial returns for all stakeholders. 
The Committee therefore decided it remained important to focus the annual bonus framework on: 
• Improving our service to our customers. • Improvingtheengagementofallofourcolleagues–ifourcolleaguessmile,ourcustomerssmiletoo. • Being a business that puts back into our community. 
Group customer service and Group colleague engagement is objectively measured through our management Steering Wheel which ensures that we manage in a balanced way across our business.

Bonus targets are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive as they would give away details of our budgeting to our competitors. We therefore do not publish the details of targets. However, targets are considered to be measurable and appropriately stretching. If they are achieved the Committee considers that value will have been added for shareholders. 
The Committee will provide an explanation of the rationale for the level of any bonus paid in the 2014/15 Directors’ Remuneration Report including details of where performance fell within the target range to ensure transparency for shareholders regarding the level of reward paid in the context of performance delivered. The Committee will disclose performance targets when they are no longer considered to be commercially sensitive. 
Long-term performance 

Performance measure 
Link to strategy 
Earnings per share and return on capital employed (matrix) 
The ultimate goal of our strategy is to provide long-term sustainable returns for all of our shareholders. Tesco believes that the best way to deliver enhanced value is to grow earnings over the long term while maintaining a sustainable level of return on capital employed – in other words to keep growing the size of the business in an efficient way. 
2014 Performance Share Plan awards will continue to be subject to performance against a matrix of stretching earnings growth targets and sustainable return on capital performance. The Committee believes that this combination of EPS growth and ROCE performance is strongly aligned with our strategic objectives and also reflects the drivers of long-term shareholder value. 
Performance targets are outlined in the table on page 43 and are unchanged from the 2013 awards.

What did we pay Executive Directors in 2013/14? 
The table below provides a ‘single figure’ of remuneration. Where necessary, further explanations of the values provided are included below. This table and the relevant explanation has been audited. 
	.	1  Benefits include car benefits (for 2013/14 Philip Clarke – £45k, Laurie McIlwee – £33k), drivers (for 2013/14 Philip Clarke – £27k, Laurie McIlwee – £31k), security (for 2013/14 Philip Clarke – £13k, Laurie McIlwee – £29k), taxable travel, disability and health insurance, membership at clubs, Shares in Success awarded under the all-employee Share Incentive Plan and the value of the discount for shares awarded under the Sharesave during the year. Philip Clarke’s benefits for 2012/13 now include fuel costs which were not known when the report was published. The benefit costs shown have been grossed up for tax.  
	.	2  Pension is calculated as the difference between the end of year defined benefit accrued pension and the beginning of year accrued pension increased by the September CPI in the preceding tax year, multiplied by a factor of 20. The pension figure for 2012/13 has been set to nil where the increase in pension earned over the year was lower than the CPI increase to the pension built up at the beginning of the year.  
	.	3  Laurie McIlwee resigned and ceased to be a director on 4 April 2014. Details of his leaving arrangements are provided on page 51.

The business has made good progress this year against our key strategic objectives designed to strengthen our underlying business. We have increased internet sales by 15% reflecting our focus on our multichannel strategy. We are getting better feedback from customers and colleagues and have significantly reduced the level of CO2 used across the Group. Despite this progress the bonus profit underpin was not met and therefore the Executive Directors will not receive a bonus in respect of 2013/14. 
Bonus targets are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive. We have therefore not published the details of targets.

Long-term incentives 
Vesting of 2011/12 to 2013/14 awards 
Awards granted in 2011 which were subject to performance to the end of 2013/14 were the first cycle of awards under the current long-term incentive framework to vest under which awards were made entirely in performance shares (rather than a mix of performance shares and market value share options). Performance targets for these awards were set as a matrix of stretching earnings growth and sustainable return on capital employed targets. 
This table has been audited.

Awards granted in 2011 will therefore lapse in July 2014. 
Information regarding remuneration outcomes for 2012/13 is set out in the 2012/13 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Aligning pay with performance 
The following charts illustrate performance at Tesco against key performance indicators over the past five years. 2012/13 financial information has been restated for retrospective changes to an accounting standard (IAS 19), a change in definition to underlying profit and to exclude China which is now treated as a discontinued operation. See notes to the accounts for more information. 
The FTSE 100 index has been selected to compare Tesco’s TSR against as it is a broad market index of which Tesco is a constituent.

Shareholding guidelines and share ownership 
Share ownership guidelines 
The Remuneration Committee believes that a significant shareholding by Executive Directors aligns their interests with shareholders and demonstrates their ongoing commitment to the business. 
Policy for calculating shareholding 
• Shares included – Shares held outright will be included in the calculation of shareholding guidelines as will shares held by an Executive’s spouse. Shares held in plans which are not subject to forfeiture will be included (on a net of tax basis) for the purposes of calculating Executive Directors’ shareholdings. Vested but unexercised market value share options are not included in the calculation. 
• Five years for new appointees to build shareholdings – New appointees will be expected to achieve this minimum level of shareholding within five years of appointment. When the shareholding guidelines were increased in 2011, Executives were given a period of five years to meet this enhanced requirement and therefore should meet the requirement by June 2016. 
• PSP participation may be subject to maintaining holding – Full participation in the long-term Performance Share Plan will generally be conditional upon maintaining the minimum shareholding. 
• Holding of 50% of vesting awards until requirement met – Where an Executive Director does not meet the shareholding requirement they will be required to hold, and not dispose of, at least 50% of the net number of shares which vest under incentive arrangements until they meet this requirement. 
Given the importance of owning shares, the Executive Committee and over 100 other senior managers are also required to build a holding of Tesco shares. 
The chart below illustrates the value of Executive Directors’ shareholdings, based on the three-month average share price to 22 February 2014 of 330.3p per share compared to the shareholding guideline. 
• Four times base salary for the CEO 
• Three times base salary for the CFO 
• The purpose is to create alignment with the interests of shareholders 
• This requirement is at the upper end of typical market practice for similar-sized companies

Between 22 February 2014 and 24 April 2014 Philip Clarke acquired 71 partnership shares under the all-employee Share Incentive Plan. There were no other changes in share interests. 
Share dealing policy 
Tesco has a share dealing policy in place for Executive Directors and for members of the Executive Committee. This policy prevents Executive Directors and Executive Committee members and their connected persons dealing in shares at times when this would be prohibited by the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules. At all times, Executive Directors and Executive Committee members must seek advance clearance before dealing in shares on their own behalf or in respect of their connected persons. 
Share awards awarded during 2013/14 
This table has been audited. 
1 Face value has been calculated using the average mid-market closing share price over the five days preceding the award of 364.84p which was the share price used to determine the number of shares subject to the award in accordance with the rules. 
The percentage of award vesting for awards granted in 2013 is based on EPS growth and ROCE as outlined below: 
No awards were granted during the year under the deferred bonus plan. 
Outstanding share awards subject to performance conditions 
Awards granted in previous years which remain subject to performance

50 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Pensions 
Philip Clarke and Laurie McIlwee are members of the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme, which provides a pension of up to two-thirds of base salary on retirement, normally at age 60, dependent on service (final salary scheme). 
Each year’s pension earned before 1 June 2012 will be increased with RPI up to a maximum of 5%, and pension earned after 1 June 2012 with CPI up to a maximum of 5%. 
Pension accrued before 1 June 2012 and drawn before age 60 will be actuarially reduced to reflect early retirement. Pension accrued from 1 June 2012 will be actuarially reduced if it is drawn before the age at which a full pension is paid (originally age 62 but subject to adjustment up or down to reflect unexpected changes in life expectancy). 
Since April 2006, following implementation of the regulations contained within the Finance Act 2004, Executive Directors have been eligible to receive the maximum pension that can be provided from the registered Pension Scheme without incurring additional tax charges. The balance of any pension entitlement for Executive Directors is delivered through an unfunded retirement benefit scheme (‘SURBS’). The SURBS is secured by using a fixed and floating charge over a cash deposit in a designated account. 
Executive Directors who are members of the final salary scheme are required to contribute 10% of salary. Details of the rights under the Tesco pension scheme are set out below. This table has been audited. 
	.	1  The accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at 60 (pre-June 2012 service) and from full pension age (post-June 2012 service), based on service to 22 February 2014.  
	.	2  Some of Philip Clarke and Laurie McIlwee’s benefits are payable from an unfunded pension arrangement. This is secured by a fixed and floating charge on a cash deposit.  
	.	3  The increase in accrued pension over the year is additional pension accrued during the year.  
	.	4  The transfer value basis was updated during the year following a review of the Scheme’s factors.  
Inflation over the year has been allowed for using the September 2013 CPI inflation of 2.7%. 
Payments to former directors 
This information has been audited. There were no payments made to former Directors which exceeded the de minimis threshold of £10,000 set by the Company. 
Following the sale of Fresh & Easy, the award of 2,500,000 shares plus associated dividend equivalents granted in 2007 to the former CEO, Sir Terry Leahy, under the Group New Business Incentive Plan lapsed on 14 April 2014. 
Loss of office payments 
This information has been audited. 
There were no payments for loss of office during the year. 
Leaving arrangements for Laurie McIlwee 
Laurie McIlwee resigned as CFO and as an Executive Director of Tesco PLC on 4 April 2014. Laurie remains an employee of Tesco and, for a period of six months from 4 April 2014, will be employed as CFO Emeritus performing transition activities and supporting handover with colleagues as we recruit a replacement CFO. During this period, Laurie will continue to receive his salary of £886,420 and will remain eligible to receive a bonus of up to a maximum of 200% of salary for 2014/15. Any bonus will be based on performance against targets and will be pro-rated for time in employment. 
At the end of this six month period on 3 October 2014 (termination date) Laurie will cease to be employed by Tesco. On termination of employment, in accordance with the terms of his contract, Laurie will receive a termination payment of £970,800 consisting of 12 months base salary (£886,420) and benefits (£84,460 consisting of staff discount, private healthcare and health insurance and car and car related benefits). No additional amount will be paid in respect of pension. 
Outstanding deferred share (EIP) awards will continue until the normal vesting date in accordance with the rules of the plan. Laurie will have 12 months from this date to exercise awards. 2011 awards vest on 14 May 2014. The 2012 award will vest on 25 May 2015. No deferred share award was made in 2013 and no award will be made in 2014. The number of shares subject to each award is set out in the table on page 50.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 
Directors’ remuneration report continued Annual remuneration report 
As described above, 2011 PSP awards are due to lapse on 14 July 2014. PSP awards granted to Laurie in 2012 and 2013 will lapse upon him leaving the business. Laurie may exercise vested discretionary share option awards granted in 2007, 2008 and 2009 for a period of 12 months from termination, in accordance with the terms of the plan rules. These awards are, however, currently underwater. 
The awards granted under the all-employee Sharesave scheme in 2011, 2012 and 2013 will lapse and the awards granted in 2009 and 2010 may be exercised in accordance with the rules of the plan. Shares held under the all-employee Share Incentive Plan will be transferred to Laurie in accordance with the rules of the plan. 
The Company will pay for out-placement services and legal costs in connection with Laurie’s termination of employment up to a maximum of £50,000 and £5,000 excluding VAT respectively. 
Other policy information 
Risk management 
Risk management is an important part of business process. The Committee considers that Tesco’s processes in this area provide the necessary controls to prevent inappropriate risk taking. When reviewing remuneration structures the Committee considered whether any aspect of these might encourage behaviours that are incompatible with our Tesco Values and the long-term interests of shareholders. If necessary, the Committee would take appropriate steps to address this. 
Outside appointments 
Tesco recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other companies. Such Non-executive duties can broaden a Director’s experience and knowledge which can benefit Tesco. 
Subject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are allowed to accept Non-executive appointments, provided that these appointments are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest, and they may retain the fees received. Currently neither Philip Clarke nor Laurie McIlwee hold any outside appointments. 
Funding of equity awards 
Executive incentive arrangements are funded by a mix of newly issued shares and shares purchased in the market. Where shares are newly issued the Company complies with ABI dilution guidelines on their issue. The current dilution usage of discretionary plans is c.3.5% of shares in issue. Where shares are purchased in the market, these may be held by Tesco Employees Share Schemes Trustees Limited, in which case the voting rights relating to the shares are exercisable by the trustees in accordance with their fiduciary duties. At 22 February 2014 the trust held 3,182,335 shares. 
Other disclosures 
Change in CEO remuneration compared to the change in colleague remuneration 
The following table illustrates the change in CEO salary, benefits and bonus between 2012/13 and 2013/14 compared to other UK colleagues. 
The Committee decided to use other UK colleagues for the purpose of this disclosure as over half of our colleagues are based in the UK and the CEO is also predominately based in the UK (albeit with a global role and responsibilities). The Committee therefore considered that this is an appropriate comparator group given that pay changes across the Group depend on local market conditions. 
* No bonuses were paid in respect of 2013/14 or 2012/13. 
Relative importance of spend on pay 
The following chart shows total employee pay compared to distributions to shareholders. 
At Tesco our colleagues are an essential part of how we do business and how we meet our customer needs. Over the last two years we have invested in our colleagues, increasing the number of colleagues in store to improve the offering to our customers. In 2012/13 we employed an average of 506,856 colleagues across the Group. This has increased to 510,444 in 2013/14. 
Total employee pay includes wages and salaries, social security, pension and share based costs. (£6,885m in 2012/13 and £7,271m in 2013/14 – see Note 4 of the accounts on page 83). 
Distributions to shareholders includes interim and final dividends paid in respect of each financial year (£1,186m in respect of 2012/13 and £1,193m in respect of 2013/14 – see Note 8 of the accounts on page 88). There were no share buy-backs in 2012/13 or 2013/14.

Remuneration Committee advisors are appointed by the Committee following a selection process and their roles are kept under review. During the year, Deloitte LLP have been retained by the Committee in their capacity as independent Remuneration Committee Advisors. Fees for advice provided to the Remuneration Committee for the year were £151,646. Fees are charged on a time and materials basis. Deloitte also provided advice to management in relation to the interpretation of the Remuneration Reporting Regulations, below board remuneration and implementation of share plans. Separate teams within Deloitte provided unrelated advisory services in respect of corporate tax planning, technology consulting, risk management, share schemes, international taxation, corporate finance and treasury to the Group during the year. 
Deloitte is one of the founding members of the Remuneration Consultants Code of Conduct and adheres to this Code in its dealings with the Committee. The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Deloitte is objective and independent. The Committee is comfortable that the Deloitte LLP engagement partner and team, that provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with Tesco PLC that may impair their independence. The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts. 
Towers Watson also provided the Committee with benchmarking information during the year and fees on a time spent basis for this were £32,700. 
Jonathan Lloyd, the Company Secretary, is Secretary to the Committee. Philip Clarke (Chief Executive of the Group) and the Group CFO attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee. They are not present when their own remuneration is being discussed. The Committee is supported by Alison Homer (Group Personnel Director), Drew Matthews (Group Remuneration Director) and Corporate Secretariat and Finance functions. 
Compliance 
In carrying out its duties, the Remuneration Committee gives full consideration to best practice. The Committee was constituted and operated throughout the period in accordance with the principles outlined in the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority derived from the UK Corporate Governance Code. The auditors’ report, set out on pages 65 to 68, covers the disclosures referred to in this report that are specified for audit by the Financial Conduct Authority. 
The report has been drawn up in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as updated in 2013) and the Financial Conduct Authority Listing Rules. 
Shareholder voting 
Tesco remains committed to ongoing shareholder dialogue and carefully reviews voting outcomes on remuneration matters. In the event of a substantial vote against a resolution in relation to Directors’ remuneration, Tesco would seek to understand the reasons for any such vote, and would detail any actions in response to it in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
The following table sets out actual voting in respect of our remuneration report in 2013.

	•	Base salary provides fixed remuneration for the role, which reflects the size and scope of the Executive Directors’ responsibilities and their experience.  
	•	The Committee sets base salary taking into account: 
		–  The individual’s skills and  experience and their performance.  
		–  SalarylevelsatleadingFTSE  companies and other large consumer business companies in the UK and internationally.  
		–  Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group.  
	•	Base salary is normally reviewed annually with changes effective from 1 July but may be reviewed more frequently if the Committee determines this is appropriate.

	•	However,increasesmaybeabovethis level in certain circumstances such as: 
		–  WhereanewExecutiveDirector  has been appointed to the Board at a lower than typical market salary to allow for growth in the role then larger increases may be awarded to move salary positioning closer to typical market level as the Executive gains experience.  
		–  WhereanExecutiveDirectorhas been promoted or has had a change in responsibilities, salary increases in excess of the above limit may be awarded.

Information supporting the policy table 
Tesco also operates shareholding guidelines. See page 48 of the Annual Remuneration Report for further details. 
Awards may incorporate the right (in cash or shares) to receive the value of dividends between grant and exercise in respect of the number of shares that vest. The calculation of dividend equivalents may assume reinvestment of those dividends in Company shares on a cumulative basis. 
The Committee has the discretion to scale back deferred share awards and performance share awards prior to the satisfaction of awards in the event that results are materially misstated or the participant has contributed to serious reputational damage of the Company or one of its business units or his conduct has amounted to serious misconduct, fraud or misstatement. Other elements 
of remuneration are not subject to clawback or malus. 
If the Committee considers it to be appropriate, it may determine that share awards may be settled in cash. 
The Committee may amend the terms of awards or the rules of share plans within the scope defined in the rules of the plans. 
For share awards, in the event of a variation of the Company’s share capital or a demerger, delisting, special dividend, rights issue or other event, which may, in the Remuneration Committee’s opinion affect the current or future value of awards, the number of shares subject to an award may be adjusted. 
The Committee may amend performance targets in accordance with the terms of an award or if a transaction occurs which causes the Committee to consider (taking into account the interest of shareholders) that an amended performance condition would be more appropriate and would continue to achieve the original purpose. 
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out in this report where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for 
the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration, and an award over shares is ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted. 
The Committee may make minor changes to this Policy for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without seeking shareholder approval for that amendment. 
Prior to 2011 Executive Directors were granted market value options under the Company’s 2004 Discretionary Share Option plan. Outstanding awards are no longer subject to performance and may be exercised until the 10th anniversary of the date of award. No further awards will be made under this plan. 
Selection of performance measures 
Annual bonus 
The annual bonus performance measures have been selected to provide an appropriate balance between incentivising Executive Directors to meet financial targets for the year and incentivising them to achieve specific strategic objectives. This allows the Company to more specifically incentivise the delivery of key elements of our strategy. The particular bonus metrics are selected by the Committee each year to ensure that Executive Directors are appropriately focused on the key objectives for the next 12 months. 
Performance share plan 
The ultimate goal of our strategy is to provide long-term sustainable returns for all of our shareholders. Tesco believes that the best way to deliver enhanced value is to grow earnings over the long term while maintaining a sustainable level of capital efficiency – in other words to keep growing the size of the business in an efficient way. The measures used in the PSP reflect this. 
Performance targets for both the annual bonus and Performance Share Plan are set taking into account internal budget forecasts, external expectations and the need to ensure that targets remain motivational. 
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group 
Remuneration arrangements are determined throughout the Group based on the same principle; that reward should be sufficient to attract and retain high calibre talent without paying more than is necessary and that reward should support the delivery of the business strategy. 
Tesco is one of the largest public company employers in the world. Our colleagues undertake a variety of roles reflecting the countries we operate in and the range of skills we need to run our various businesses (from stores to banking to telecoms). Reward packages therefore differ taking into account location, seniority and level of responsibility but they are all built around the common reward objectives and principles outlined above. The following is based on current practice which may change during the life of the policy. 
• Annual bonus – Annual bonuses throughout the Group are linked to local business performance, Group success and, where appropriate, individual contribution in a structure that is consistent with the Executive Directors’ annual bonus with a focus on financial and strategic measures. 
• Share incentives – Currently our 5,000 strong management team across the Group participates in share incentives to create alignment with shareholder interests. The management team also receives some of their bonus in Tesco shares deferred for 
a period of two or three years. • Pensions – Pensions across the Group vary widely according 
to local market practice. In the UK all Tesco colleagues currently have the opportunity to participate in a career average defined benefit scheme up to tax approved limits. This benefit is unique in comparison with our key retail peers. 
• Colleagues as shareholders – It is an important part of the Tesco Values that all colleagues, not just management, have the opportunity to become Tesco shareholders. Over 200,000 of our colleagues participate in our all-employee schemes and hold over 119 million shares in our Share Incentive Plan and over 127 million options over shares in our Sharesave scheme. 
When determining Executive Director remuneration arrangements the Committee takes into account pay conditions throughout the Group to ensure that the structure and quantum of Executive Directors’ pay remains appropriate in this context. 

58 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios Tesco remuneration arrangements have been designed to ensure that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of short-term and long-term goals that are aligned with our short-term and long-term strategic objectives and the creation of shareholder value. The Committee considers the level of remuneration that may payout in different performance scenarios to ensure that this 
is considered appropriate in the context of the performance delivered and the value added for shareholders. The charts below show hypothetical values of the remuneration package for Executive Directors under three assumed performance scenarios: 
Remuneration policy for new hires 
The Committee would generally seek to align the remuneration package offered to new executives with our remuneration policy outlined in the table above. When determining appropriate remuneration arrangements the Committee will take into account all relevant factors including the experience and calibre of the candidate, the candidate’s current reward opportunity, and the jurisdiction the candidate was recruited from. 
In respect of an Executive Director’s appointment the Committee may offer variable remuneration arrangements that it considers appropriate and necessary to recruit and retain the individual (subject to the maximum variable limit outlined below). 
Variable remuneration awarded in respect of an Executive Director’s appointment shall be limited to the current aggregate annual and PSP award policy of 600% of base salary. This limit includes awards granted under the normal policy outlined above but excluding any awards made to compensate the Executive Director for awards forfeited from their previous employer. 
The Committee may make awards when appointing an Executive Director to ‘buy out’ remuneration terms forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted (e.g. cash or shares) and the time over which they would have vested. 
The Committee’s key principle is that generally buy-out awards will be made on a comparable basis to those forfeited. 
To facilitate buy-out awards outlined above, in the event of recruitment, the Committee may grant awards to a new Executive Director under the Listing Rule 9.4.2 which allows for the granting of awards, to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of an Executive Director, or under other relevant company incentive plans. 
In the event that an internal candidate was promoted to the Board legacy terms and conditions would normally be honoured, including pension entitlements and any outstanding incentive awards. 
In the event of the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-executive Director remuneration arrangements will normally reflect the policy outlined on page 61 for Chairmen and Non-executive Directors. 
Executive Director service contracts and policy on Executive Directors leaving Tesco When determining leaving arrangements for an Executive Director the Committee takes into account any contractual agreements including the provisions of any incentive arrangements, typical market practice and the performance and conduct of the individual. 
The following table summarises our policy in relation to Executive Director service contracts and payments in the event of loss of office.

Share plan rules – leaver provisions 
The treatment of outstanding share awards in the event that an Executive Director leaves is governed by the relevant share plan rules. The following table summarises leaver provisions under the executive share plans. In specific circumstances the Committee may exercise its discretion to modify the policy outlined to the extent that the rules of the share plan allow such discretion. The Committee will not exercise discretion to allow awards to vest where the participant is dismissed for gross misconduct. 

Death 
‘Good leavers’ as determined by the Committee in accordance with the plan rules 
Leavers in other circumstances (other than summary dismissal) 


‘Good leavers’ are: injury, ill-heath or disability, redundancy, retirement, the entity which employs the Executive ceasing to be part of the group or any other reason determined by the Committee taking into account the circumstances of departure and performance.

All-employee share plans 
• Leaver provisions under all-employee share plans are as determined in accordance with HMRC approved provisions. 
Legacy plans 
Deferred shares awarded prior to 2014 were granted under the 2004 Executive Incentive Plan. Under this plan in the event that a participant leaves for ‘good leaver’ reasons (death, injury, ill-heath, disability, redundancy, retirement, the entity which employs the Executive Director 

60 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
ceasing to be part of the group or any other reason determined by the Committee) awards will vest at leaving and participants will normally have 12 months from cessation to exercise awards in the form of options. If a participant leaves in other circumstances (other than in circumstances of gross misconduct) awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date and participants will normally have 12 months from vesting to exercise awards in the form of options. Executive Directors hold vested options under the 2004 Discretionary Share Option Plan. When an Executive Director leaves they would have 12 months from leaving to exercise options (three years in the case of ‘good leavers’ as set out above). 
Other vesting circumstances 
Awards may also vest early if: (i) a participant is transferred to a country, as a result of which the participant will suffer a tax disadvantage or become subject to 
restrictions on his award; or (ii) in the event of a takeover, winding-up or other corporate event affecting the Company, which may affect the value of share awards 
(such as a demerger or special dividend). 
The number of shares under an award which vest in these circumstances will be determined by the Committee. In the case of the PSP when determining the level of vesting the Committee will consider performance and the time elapsed since grant. In the case of the deferred bonus shares (under the 2004 and 2014 EIP) awards will vest in full. 
Where an Executive Director leaves as a result of summary dismissal they will forfeit outstanding share incentive awards.

Non-executive Director letters of appointment 
Non-executive Directors have letters of appointment setting out their duties and the time commitment expected. Appointments are for an initial period of three years after which they are reviewed. In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Non-executive Directors submit themselves for re-election by shareholders every year at the Annual General Meeting. All Non-executive Directors’ appointments can be terminated by either party without notice. Non-executive Directors have no entitlement to compensation on termination. 
The letters of appointment are available for shareholders to view at the Company’s registered office. 
Considering colleagues views 
The Committee does not consider that it is appropriate to consult directly with colleagues when developing the Directors’ remuneration policy. A significant portion of our colleagues are shareholders so are able to express their views in the same way as other shareholders. 
The Company undertakes an annual viewpoint survey for all Group employees to understand their views on working for Tesco and how this can be improved. Feedback on employee reward is provided as part of this survey. 
The Committee reviews information regarding the typical remuneration structure and reward levels for other UK based employees to provide context when determining executive remuneration policy. 
Considering shareholders’ views 
The Committee believes that it is very important to maintain open dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters. The Committee regularly consults with significant shareholders regarding potential changes to remuneration arrangements and the views of shareholders are important in determining any final changes. Going forward the Committee will continue to liaise with shareholders regarding remuneration matters more generally and Tesco arrangements as appropriate. It is the Committee’s intention to consult with major shareholders in advance of making any material changes to remuneration arrangements.

The Company has chosen, in accordance with Section 414 C(ii) of the Companies Act 2006, and as noted in this Directors’ report, to include certain matters in its Strategic report that would otherwise be required to be disclosed in this Directors’ report. The Strategic report can be found on pages 1 to 25 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. 
Group results* 
Group revenue (excluding VAT) rose by £151 million to £63.6 billion, representing an increase of 0.2%. Group profit before tax increased by £202 million to £2,259 million. Profit for the year including discontinued operations was £970 million, of which £974 million was attributable to equity holders of the parent company. 
Dividends 
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 10.13p per ordinary share, to be paid on 4 July 2014 to members on the Register at the close of business on 2 May 2014. Together with the interim dividend of 4.63p per ordinary share paid in December 2013, the full-year dividend will be maintained at 14.76p per ordinary share (2012/13: 14.76p). 
Fixed assets* 
Capital expenditure (excluding business combinations) amounted to £2.7 billion compared with £2.7 billion the previous year. 
Share capital and control of the Company and significant agreements Details of the Company’s share capital, including changes during the year in the issued share capital and details of the rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, are set out in Note 27 on 
page 116 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. No shareholder holds securities carrying special rights with regards to control of the Company. There are no restrictions on voting rights or the transfer of securities in the Company and the Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that result in such restrictions. 
The Company was authorised by shareholders at the 2013 AGM to purchase its own shares in the market up to a maximum of approximately 10% of its issued share capital. No shares were purchased under that authority during the financial year. The Company is seeking to renew the authority at the forthcoming AGM, within the limits set out in the notice of that meeting. 
Shares held by the Company’s Employee Share Incentive Plan Trust, International Employee Benefit Trust, Tesco Ireland Share Bonus Scheme Trust and Tesco Employee Share Scheme Trust rank pari passu with the shares in issue and have no special rights.

Directors and their interests 
The Directors who served during the year were: Mark Armour; Sir Richard Broadbent; Gareth Bullock; Patrick Cescau; Stuart Chambers; Philip Clarke; Olivia Garfield; Ken Hanna; Laurie McIlwee; Deanna Oppenheimer; and Jacqueline Tammenoms Bakker. Laurie McIlwee stepped down as CFO and from the Board with effect from 4 April 2014. The biographical details of the Directors are set out on pages 26 and 27 of this Annual Report. 
The interests of Directors and their immediate families in the shares of Tesco PLC, along with details of Directors’ share options, are contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report set out on pages 41 to 61. 
At no time during the year did any of the Directors have a material interest in any significant contract with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. A qualifying third-party indemnity provision as defined in Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006 is in force for the benefit of each of the Directors and the Company Secretary (who is also a Director of certain subsidiaries of the Company) in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office, to the extent permitted by law. In respect of those liabilities for which directors may not be indemnified, the Company maintained a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy throughout the financial year. 
Employment policies 
Our core purpose is at the heart of our business: ‘we make what matters better, together’ applies to our colleagues as well as our customers and communities. 
We believe it is essential for our colleagues to have a voice. Listening and connecting with colleagues enables us to understand what matters to them and to respond by taking action to make what matters better. We use a variety of communication channels to regularly engage, consult, inform and connect with our teams so that the views of our colleagues can be taken into account when key decisions are made that affect them. 
Our Values underpin our development of fair and inclusive policies and encourage advocacy, engagement and loyalty so that our colleagues can be their best and help to deliver a fantastic customer experience. Collaboration and working as one team means we make a greater difference collectively rather than as individuals. 

62 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
We are committed to improving the skills, knowledge and wellbeing of our colleagues. Our selection, training, development and promotion policies ensure equal opportunities for all colleagues regardless of factors such as gender, marital status, race, age, sexual preference and orientation, colour, creed, ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability or trade union affiliation. All decisions are based on merit. 
We actively encourage colleagues to become involved in the financial performance of our business through a variety of voluntary share schemes. 
Political donations 
The Group did not make any political donations (2012/13: £nil) or incur any political expenditure during the year (2012/13: £33,583). 
Compliance with the Groceries (Supply Chain Practices) Market Investigation Order 2009 and the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (‘Code’) The Code places obligations on grocery retailers with a turnover greater than £1 billion to maintain a Code compliance programme, which includes training staff and providing information to the Competition and Markets Authority. In addition, the Code sets out a number of provisions which relate to different aspects of the relationship between a retailer and supplier. 
We are committed to treating our suppliers fairly and work in collaboration with them wherever possible. We have in place a Code Compliance Officer supported by a compliance team including a Code auditor. We have an audit plan and our approach enables us to identify any gaps in our processes so they can be quickly fixed. We also have in place an ongoing compliance training programme for our buying teams, with comprehensive training 
for relevant new starters and annual refresher training. We have strengthened our compliance in this area through the improvement of our e-learning tool to provide interactive online training for staff. We have also generated new mechanisms to improve our paperwork and agreements with our suppliers. 
In the past year we have actively engaged and co-operated with the recently created Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA), Christine Tacon, and her office. We have also focused on communication and dialogue with our suppliers. 
Twelve Code-related complaints were raised by suppliers this year, all of which were resolved through discussion with the suppliers concerned. We have had two instances where complaints were referred to the Code Compliance Officer, although in neither of those instances was a formal dispute raised as both matters were resolved with the suppliers concerned. There was one instance in which an alleged breach was raised by a third party in relation to requests to a limited number of suppliers for funding associated with shelf positioning. The requests from suppliers were withdrawn and the matter was openly discussed with the GCA. Consequently, the GCA issued a GSCOP clarification in March 2014 on the issue. This provided guidance for suppliers and retailers on the interpretation of the GSCOP provisions relating to shelf positioning. The Code Compliance Officer regularly reports to our Compliance Committees and Audit Committee, which retain effective oversight of our compliance with the Code. 
Going concern 
The Directors consider that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to remain in operation for the foreseeable future and have therefore continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Events after the Balance Sheet date 
On 21 March 2014, the Group entered into an agreement with Trent Limited, part of the Tata Group, to form a 50:50 joint venture in Trent Hypermarket Limited which operates the Star Bazaar retail business in India. The Group’s investment is £85 million. 
On 2 April 2014, the Group, through its subsidiary dunnhumby Limited, acquired Sociomantic Labs (‘Sociomantic’), a Berlin-based global leader in digital advertising solutions, for £124 million. Sociomantic operates in 14 countries worldwide, with clients in retail, financial services and travel services. 
Auditors 
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors of the Company and the Group will be proposed at the 2014 AGM. 
Directors’ statement of disclosure of information to auditors 
Having made the requisite enquiries, the Directors in office at the date of this Annual Report and Financial Statements have each confirmed that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006) of which the Group’s auditors are unaware, and each of the Directors has taken all the steps he/she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of that information. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 
of the Companies Act 2006. 
Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information 
Where this document contains forward-looking statements, these are made by the Directors in good faith based on the information available to them at the time of their approval of this report. These statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent risks and uncertainties underlying any such forward- looking information. The Group cautions investors that a number of factors, including matters referred to in this document, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed under ‘Principal risks and uncertainties’ on pages 20 to 25 of this Annual Report.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 2006 to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for the financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards. 
In preparing the Group and Company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
	•	select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;  
	•	make reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates;  
	•	for the Group financial statements, state whether they have  been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU;  
	•	for the Company financial statements, state whether applicable  UK Accounting Standards have been followed; and  
	•	prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis,  unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue in business.  The Directors, whose names and functions are set out on pages 26 and 27 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:  
	•	the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and  
	•	the Strategic report contained within this document includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, as well as a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.  
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s and Group’s performance, business model and strategy. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK concerning the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 

64 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Tesco PLC 
Report on the Group financial statements Our opinion In our opinion the Group financial statements, defined below: 
	•	give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 22 February 2014 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the 52 weeks then ended;  
	•	have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; and  
	•	have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.  What we have audited  The Group financial statements, which are prepared by Tesco PLC, comprise:  
	•	the Group balance sheet as at 22 February 2014;  
	•	the Group income statement and statement of comprehensive  income for the 52 weeks then ended;  
	•	the Group statement of changes in equity and cash flow  statement for the 52 weeks then ended; and  
	•	the notes to the Group financial statements, which include  a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.  The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.  Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report and Financial Statements (the ‘Annual Report’), rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.  What an audit of financial statements involves  We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:  
	•	whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;  
	•	the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and  
	•	the overall presentation of the financial statements.  In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited Group financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on,  or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.  
Overview of our audit approach 
Materiality 
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be £150 million. This represents approximately 5% of profit before tax adjusted for restructuring and one-off items. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £7 million as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Overview of the scope of our audit 
The Group is primarily structured as three geographic regions, being UK, Asia and Europe, and Tesco Bank. The Group financial statements are a consolidation of nineteen reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating businesses and centralised functions, within these regions. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at reporting units by us, as the Group engagement team, or component auditors within PwC UK and from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
Accordingly, we identified three reporting units which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, either due to their size or their risk characteristics. These three reporting units accounted for 92% of the Group’s profit before tax adjusted for restructuring and one-off items, of which the main UK trading business contributed 73%. Audits of their complete financial information were also performed for a further eight overseas reporting units where there are local statutory reporting requirements and specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were performed at a further two reporting units. Our audit work at these reporting units, together with additional procedures performed at the Group level, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.

Areas of particular audit focus 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. We primarily focused our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us 
Area of focus 
Recognition of commercial income 
Commercial income (promotional monies, discounts and rebates receivable from suppliers) recognised during the year is material to the income statement and amounts accrued at the year end are judgemental. 
We focused on this area because of the judgement required in accounting for the commercial income deals and the risk of manipulation of these balances. 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
We focused on this area because the determination of whether or not an impairment charge for property, plant and equipment is necessary involves significant judgements by the Directors about the future results of the business and assessment of future plans for the Group’s property portfolio in a number of territories. 
to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of all risks or areas of focus identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. Their report on those matters that they considered to be significant issues in relation to the financial statements is set out on page 33. 
How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus 
We tested the controls management has in place, focusing on controls over price changes and margin reviews. 
We agreed commercial income recognised to contractual evidence with suppliers, with particular attention to the period in which the income was recorded and the appropriateness of the accrual at the year end. 
We compared movements year on year in margins for product categories based on an expectation derived from our sample testing of contracts with suppliers. 
We evaluated the Directors’ impairment calculations in local territories, assessing the future cash flow forecasts used in the models, and the process by which they were drawn up, including comparing them to the latest Board approved budgets, and testing the underlying calculations. We challenged: 
	•	the key assumptions for long-term growth rates in the forecasts by comparing them to historical results, and economic and industry forecasts;  
	•	the discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the Company and comparable organisations; and  
	•	the alternative use value for land not expected to be developed.  We also performed sensitivity analysis around the key drivers of growth rates of the cash flow forecasts, including revenue growth and expected changes in margins. Having ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions that either individually or collectively would be required for the assets to be impaired, we considered the likelihood of such a movement in those key assumptions arising.  
     
66 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Area of focus 
Valuation of assets held for sale 
We focused on this area due to the significant and complex judgements required over determining the fair value of the Group’s operations in China, which are disclosed in the financial statements within assets held for sale. 
Provisions and reserves in Tesco Bank 
We focused on this area because of the significant judgement required by the Directors in determining the level of provision for the following areas: 
• Loan, credit card and mortgage impairments • Provisions of customer redress • Insurance reserving 
Risk of management override of internal controls 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this. 
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue recognition because of the pressure management may feel to achieve the planned results. Therefore we focused on the occurrence of transactions and whether they were recorded in the period in which the Group became entitled to record revenue. 
How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus 
We assessed and challenged the valuation techniques and assumptions in the third party valuation report commissioned by management. This included assessing and challenging: 
• the independence, scope of work and findings of management’s third partyvaluation expert; and 
• the cashflow forecasts and key assumptions over growth and discount rates. 
We also assessed the valuation against available entity specific and similar transaction market data. 
We assessed the overall control environment at Tesco Bank and performed a combination of internal controls testing and substantive testing. We tested the year end product reconciliations, the impairment provisions recognised and the level of suspended interest. 
We have assessed and challenged the assumptions made by management in calculating the provisions for redress. We have reviewed historical data to assess whether trends in customer claims have been accurately reflected in the provisions. 
We evaluated the work performed by independent actuaries and challenged the key assumptions the Directors have made for insurance reserving by using our market knowledge of the UK Motor and Household insurance products to perform corroborative analytics. 
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including the arrangements for staff to “whistleblow” inappropriate actions, and interviewed senior management and the Group’s internal audit function. We examined the significant accounting estimates and judgements relevant to the financial statements for evidence of bias by the Directors that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We also tested manual journal entries and incorporated an element of unpredictability in the timing of our work into our testing plans. 
We tested controls over the recording of revenue in the relevant IT systems and performed substantive testing of revenue recorded during the year. We tested that retail sales transactions are supported by cash receipts and also tested journal entries posted to revenue accounts to identify unusual or irregular items.

Going Concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 64, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group’s financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception Adequacy of information and explanations received Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law have not been made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’). We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
On page 64 of the Annual Report, as required by the Code Provision C.1.1, the Directors state that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. On page 34, as required by C.3.8 of the Code, the Audit Committee has set out the significant issues that it considered in relation to the financial statements, and how they were addressed. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
	•	the statement given by the Directors is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or  
	•	the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.  We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.  
Other information in the Annual Report 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Group financial statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
• is otherwise misleading. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Our responsibilities and those of the directors As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 64, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 73 
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 
Notes to the Group financial statements 
Note 1 Accounting policies 
General information 
Tesco PLC (‘the Company’) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 (Registration number 445790). The address of the registered office is Tesco House, Delamare Road, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, EN8 9SL, UK. 
The financial year represents the 52 weeks ended 22 February 2014 (prior financial year 52 weeks ended 23 February 2013). For the UK, the Republic of Ireland and the US, the results are for the 52 weeks ended 22 February 2014 (prior financial year 52 weeks ended 23 February 2013). For all other operations, the results are for the calendar year ended 28 February 2014 (prior financial year ended 28 February 2013). 
The main activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (together, ‘the Group’) are those of retailing and retail banking. 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations as endorsed by the European Union, and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated Group financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, generally rounded to the nearest million. They are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments, share-based payments, customer loyalty programmes and pensions that have been measured at fair value. 
Discontinued operations 
During the period, the Group entered into definitive agreements, subject to the usual regulatory approvals, with China Resources Enterprise, Limited to combine respective Chinese retail operations. The definitive agreements allow for the exchange of the Group’s Chinese retail and property interests plus cash of HK$4,325m for a 20% interest in the combined businesses. 
On 27 November 2013 the Group completed a sale of the substantive part of its US operations to YFE Holdings, Inc. with the remaining assets of the US operations being disposed of as part of an orderly restructuring process. In addition, the exit of the Japanese operations was successfully completed on 1 January 2013. 
In accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’, the net results of these operations for the year are presented within discontinued operations in the Group Income Statement (for which the comparatives have been restated) and the assets and liabilities of the operations are presented separately in the Group Balance Sheet. See Note 7 for further details. 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated Group financial statements consist of the financial statements of the ultimate Parent Company (‘Tesco PLC’), all entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) and the Group’s share of its interests in joint ventures and associates. 
Subsidiaries 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Joint ventures and associates 
The Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates is included in the Group Income Statement using the equity method of accounting. Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Group Balance Sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the entity, less any impairment in value. The carrying values of investments in joint ventures and associates include acquired goodwill. 
If the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture or associate equals or exceeds its investment in the joint venture or associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate. 
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. 
Use of assumptions and estimates 
The preparation of the consolidated Group financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Critical estimates and assumptions that are applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include: 
Depreciation and amortisation 
The Group exercises judgement to determine useful lives and residual values of intangibles, property, plant and equipment and investment property. The assets are depreciated down to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. 
Impairment i) Impairment of goodwill The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units has been determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates as set out in Note 10. 
ii) Impairment of assets 
The Group has determined each store as a separate cash-generating unit for impairment testing. Where there are indicators for impairment, the Group performs an impairment test. Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections for generally five years using data from the Group’s latest internal forecasts. These calculations require the use of estimates as set out in Note 11. 
iii) Impairment of loans and advances to customers and banks 
The Group’s loan impairment provisions are established to recognise incurred impairment losses in its portfolio of loans classified as loans and receivables and carried at amortised cost. These calculations require the use of estimates as set out in the accounting policy note for financial instruments. 
Provisions 
Provisions have been made for onerous leases, dilapidations, restructuring, pensions, and customer redress. These provisions are estimates and the actual costs and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. The difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made. 
The Group has provisions for potential customer redress. In 2010/11, the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) formally issued Policy Statement 10/12 (‘PS 10/12’), which introduced new guidance in respect of Payment Protection Insurance (‘PPI’) customer redress and evidential provisions to the FCA Handbook with an implementation date of 1 December 2010. The Group continues to handle complaints and redress customers in accordance with PS 10/12. 
During the course of the year the Group identified historic operational issues that had resulted in instances where certain of the requirements of the Consumer Credit Act (‘CCA’) for post contract documentation had not been fully complied with. While there is no evidence that these issues have caused particular detriment to customers, it is the Group’s intention to provide redress to impacted customers in order to reflect the operation of the CCA in respect of the customers’ liability. 
Provision has been recognised for the CCA documentation redress and represents management’s best estimate at the reporting date of the cost of providing redress to certain loan and credit card customers. The Office of Fair Trading (‘OFT’) has been advised of the Group’s approach to determining the proposed customer redress. Oversight of CCA-related matters passed from the OFT to the FCA on 1 April 2014 and the Group expects to formally advise the FCA of the approach. 
It is not clear what regulatory position, if any, the FCA will take and as highlighted above, there is no judicial certainty in the legal position. The actual cost of customer redress could therefore differ materially from this estimate. Refer to Note 24 for further details. 
The Group is part of an industry wide Scheme of Arrangement established with the support of the relevant regulatory and customer protection bodies to address customer redress relating to the historic sale of certain cardholder protection products (‘CPP’) to credit card customers. 
 
74 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Note 1 Accounting policies continued 
The calculation of the provision is based on a series of assumptions including the number and value of cases for which compensation may be paid. In arriving at these assumptions management have exercised their judgement based on earlier redress programmes and the redress estimates provided independently as part of the industry wide Scheme of Arrangement. Refer to Note 24 for further details. 
The calculation of these provisions involves estimating a number of variables, principally the level of customer complaints which may be received and the level of any compensation which may be payable to customers. The number of cases on which compensation is ultimately payable may also be influenced by the outcome of the analysis of historical claims referred to above. A change in the estimate of any of the key variables in this calculation could have the potential to significantly impact the provisions recognised. 
Post-employment benefit obligations 
The present value of the post-employment benefit obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost (income) for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of post-employment benefit obligations. Key assumptions for post-employment benefit obligations are disclosed in Note 26. 
Adoption of new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards The Group has adopted the following new and amended standards as of 24 February 2013: 
	•	IAS 1 (amended) ‘Financial statement presentation’ changes the grouping of items presented in the Group’s Statement of Comprehensive Income so that items which may be reclassified to income statement in the future are presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Group’s financial position or performance.  
	•	IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits (Revised 2011)’ amends the accounting for employment benefits. The standard replaces the interest costs and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability/ asset. The amendment has reduced profit for the year (net of deferred tax) by £86m for the year ended 22 February 2014 (year ended 23 February 2013: a reduction of £96m). The comparative financial information has been restated accordingly.  
	•	IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted. The application of IFRS 13 has not materially impacted the  fair value measurements carried out by the Group. IFRS 13 also requires specific disclosures on fair values, some of which replace existing disclosure requirements in other standards, including IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.  
	•	IFRS 7 (amended) ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’ requires the disclosure on rights of offset and related arrangements for financial instruments under an enforceable master netting agreement or similar arrangements.  
	•	Annual Improvements 2009 – 2011 which includes changes to IAS 1 ‘Financial Statement Presentation’, IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation, IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ and IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’. The adoption of these has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in the Group financial statements.  
Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. 
Sale of goods 
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have transferred to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. 
Revenue is recorded net of returns, discounts/offers and value added taxes. 
Provision of services 
Revenue from the provision of services is recognised when the service is provided and the revenue can be measured reliably, based on the terms of the contract. 
Where the Group acts as an agent selling goods or services, only the commission income is included within revenue. 
Financial services 
Revenue consists of interest, fees and income from the provision of insurance. 
Interest income on financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables is determined using the effective interest rate method. 
Calculation of the effective interest rate takes into account fees receivable that are an integral part of the instrument’s yield, premiums or discounts on acquisition or issue, early redemption fees and transaction costs. 
Fees in respect of services (credit card interchange fees, late payment and ATM revenue) are recognised as the right to consideration accrues through the provision of the service to the customer. The arrangements are generally contractual and the cost of providing the service is incurred as the service 
is rendered. 
The Group generates commission from the sale and service of motor and home insurance policies underwritten by Tesco Underwriting Limited, or in a minority of cases by a third party underwriter. This is based on commission rates which are independent of the profitability of underlying insurance policies. Similar commission income is also generated from the sale of white label insurance products underwritten by other third party providers. 
Clubcard, loyalty and other initiatives 
The cost of Clubcard and loyalty initiatives is part of the fair value of the consideration received and is deferred and subsequently recognised over the period that the awards are redeemed. The deferral is treated as a deduction from revenue. 
The fair value of the points awarded is determined with reference to the fair value to the customer and considers factors such as redemption via Clubcard deals versus money-off-in-store and redemption rate. 
Rental income 
Rental income is recognised in the period in which it is earned, in accordance with the terms of the lease. 
Finance income 
Finance income, excluding income arising from financial services, is recognised in the period to which it relates using the effective interest rate method. 
Finance costs 
Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised. Qualifying assets are those that necessarily take a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Group Income Statement in finance costs, excluding those arising from financial services, in the period in which they occur. For Tesco Bank, finance cost on financial liabilities is determined using the effective interest rate method and is recognised in cost of sales.

Business combinations and goodwill 
The Group accounts for all business combinations by applying the purchase method. All acquisition-related costs are expensed. 
On acquisition, the assets (including intangible assets), liabilities and contingent liabilities of an acquired entity are measured at their fair value. Non-controlling interest is stated at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised. 
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the net fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary, joint venture or associate and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree. If the consideration is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity (i.e. a discount on acquisition), the difference is credited to the Group Income Statement in the period of acquisition. 
At the acquisition date of a subsidiary, goodwill acquired is recognised as an asset and is allocated to each of the cash-generating units expected to benefit from the business combination’s synergies and to the lowest level at which management monitors the goodwill. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included within the carrying value of the investment. On disposal 
of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Intangible assets 
Acquired intangible assets 
Separately acquired intangible assets, such as software, pharmacy licences, customer relationships, contracts and brands are measured initially at cost. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, at 2%-100% of cost per annum. 
Internally generated intangible assets – Research and development expenditure Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is capitalised only if specific criteria are met including that the asset created will probably generate future economic benefits. 
Following the initial recognition of development expenditure, the cost is amortised over the asset’s estimated useful life at 10%–25% of cost per annum. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment in value. 
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis to its residual value over its anticipated useful economic life. The following depreciation rates are applied for the Group: 
	•	Freeholdandleaseholdbuildingswithgreaterthan40yearsunexpired – at 2.5% of cost;  
	•	Leasehold properties with less than 40 years unexpired are depreciated by equal annual instalments over the unexpired period of the lease; and  
	•	Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings and motor vehicles – at rates varying from 9%-50%.  Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, when shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.  
Impairment of non-financial assets 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal, and value in use. When the recoverable amount of the cash- generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
For all other non-financial assets (including intangible assets and property, plant and equipment) the Group performs impairment testing where there are indicators of impairment. If such an indicator exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of the recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately as a credit to the Group Income Statement. 
Investment property 
Investment property assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment in value. The depreciation policies for investment property are consistent with those described for owner-occupied property. 
Short-term and other investments 
Short-term and other investments in the Group Balance Sheet comprise receivables, loan receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. 
Receivables and loan receivables are recognised at amortised cost. Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised at fair value. 
Refer to the financial instruments accounting policy for further detail. 
Inventories 
Inventories comprise goods and properties held for resale and properties held for, or in the course of, development with a view to sell. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell using the weighted average cost basis. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the Group Balance Sheet consist of cash at bank,inhand,demanddepositswithbanks,loansandadvancestobanks, certificate of deposits and other receivables together with short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Leasing 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 

76 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Note 1 Accounting policies continued 
The Group as a lessor 
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment in the lease. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
The Group as a lessee 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability is included in the Group Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of the lease obligations so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the Group Income Statement. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Group Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Sale and leaseback 
A sale and leaseback transaction is one where the Group sells an asset and immediately reacquires the use of the asset by entering into a lease with the buyer. 
The accounting treatment of the sale and leaseback depends upon the substance of the transaction (by applying the lease classification principles described above) whether or not the sale was made at the asset’s fair value and the relationship with the buyer which is based on levels of control and influence (the buyer may be an associate, joint venture or an unrelated party). 
For sale and finance leasebacks, any profit from the sale is deferred and amortised over the lease term. For sale and operating leasebacks, generally the assets are sold at fair value, and accordingly the profit or loss from the sale is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement. 
Post-employment and similar obligations 
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value (using the projected unit credit method) whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the Group Income Statement; service costs are spread systematically over the expected service lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense as they fall due. 
Share-based payments 
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes model. The resulting cost is charged to the Group Income Statement over the vesting period. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting. 
Taxation 
The tax expense included in the Group Income Statement consists of current and deferred tax. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Tax expense is recognised in the Group Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, in which case it is recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, respectively. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Group Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity, or other comprehensive income, respectively. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current taxation assets against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the Group Income Statement. 
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Pounds Sterling at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the Group Balance Sheet; profits and losses are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant accounting periods. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income and are included in the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are non interest-bearing and are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. 
Investments 
Investments are recognised at trade date. Investments are classified as either held for trading or available-for-sale, and are recognised at fair value. For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in the Group Income Statement for the period. Interest calculated using the effective interest rate method is recognised in the Group Income Statement. Dividends on an available-for-sale equity instrument are recognised in the Group Income Statement when the entity’s right to receive payment is established. 
Loans and advances to customers 
Loans and advances to customers are not classified as held for trading nor designated as fair value through profit and loss. Loans and advances are initially recognised at fair value plus directly related transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses. Income from these financial assets is calculated on an effective yield basis and is recognised in the Group Income Statement. 
Impairment of loans and advances to customers 
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its loans and advances to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a financial asset or group of financial assets classified as loans and advances has been incurred, the Group measures the amount of the loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets and the present value of estimated future cash flows from the asset or group of assets discounted at the effective interest rate of the instrument at initial recognition. Impairment losses are assessed individually for financial assets that are individually significant and collectively for assets that are not individually significant. 
   
Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 77 
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 
Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 1 Accounting policies continued 

In making collective assessments of impairment, financial assets are grouped into portfolios on the basis of similar risk characteristics. Future cash flows from these portfolios are estimated on the basis of the contractual cash flows and historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. Historical loss experience is adjusted, on the basis of current observable 
data, to reflect the effects of current conditions not affecting the period of historical experience. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the Group Income Statement and the carrying amount of the financial asset or group of financial assets is reduced by establishing an allowance for impairment losses. If in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss reduces and the reduction can be ascribed to an event after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance. Once an impairment loss has been recognised on a financial asset or group of financial assets, interest income is recognised on the carrying amount using the rate of interest at which estimated future cash flows were discounted in measuring impairment. 
Loan impairment provisions are established on a portfolio basis taking into account the level of arrears, security, past loss experience, credit scores and defaults based on portfolio trends. The most significant factors in establishing these provisions are the expected loss rates. 
The portfolios include credit card receivables and other personal advances. The future credit quality of these portfolios is subject to uncertainties that could cause actual credit losses to differ materially from reported loan impairment provisions. These uncertainties include the economic environment, notably interest rates and their effect on customer spending, the unemployment level, payment behaviour and bankruptcy trends. 
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest- bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between proceeds and redemption value being recognised in the Group Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are non interest-bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risks arising from operating, financing and investing activities. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes; however, if derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for as such. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on remeasurement are immediately recognised in the Group Income Statement. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective. 
Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of more than one year from the balance sheet date are disclosed as non-current. 
Fair value hedging 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group Income Statement together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
Cash flow hedging 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction. The effective element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income. 
The associated cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income and recognised in the Group Income Statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the Group Income Statement. The classification of the effective portion when recognised in the Group Income Statement is the same as the classification of the hedged transaction. Any element of the remeasurement of the derivative instrument which does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity until the forecasted transaction occurs or the original hedged item affects the Group Income Statement. If a forecasted hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity is reclassified to the Group Income Statement. 
Net investment hedging 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the Group’s net investment in an overseas operation. The effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement. Gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are included in the Group Income Statement when the foreign operation is disposed of. 
Treatment of agreements to acquire non-controlling interests 
The Group has entered into a number of agreements to purchase the remaining shares of subsidiaries with non-controlling interests. 
The net present value of the expected future payments are shown as a financial liability. At the end of each period, the valuation of the liability is reassessed with any changes recognised in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs. 
Offsetting financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Provisions 
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense. 
Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the lease. Provisions for dilapidation costs are recognised on a lease by lease basis.

Standards issued but not yet effective 
As of the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards were in issue but not yet effective. The Group has not applied these standards in the preparation of the financial statements: 
	•	IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ is effective from periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014. It builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. It also provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess.  
	•	IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ is effective from periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014. It gives a more realistic reflection of joint arrangements by focusing on the rights and obligations of the arrangement rather than its legal form. There are now only two types of joint arrangement: joint operations and joint ventures.  
	•	IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ is effective from periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014. It includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.  
	•	IAS 27 (Amended) ‘Separate financial statements’ is effective from periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014. It includes the provisions on separate financial statements that are left after the control provisions of IAS 27 have been included in the new IFRS 10.  
	•	IAS 28 (Amended) ‘Associates and joint ventures’ is effective from periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014. It includes the requirements for joint ventures, as well as associates, to be equity accounted following the issue of IFRS 11. This requirement will not affect the Group because equity accounting is currently adopted under the existing requirements of IAS 31.  
	•	IAS 32 (Amended) ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’ is effective from 1 January 2014 respectively. The amendment clarifies some of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the balance sheet.  
	•	IAS 36 (Amended) ‘Impairment of assets’ is effective from periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014. It addresses the disclosure of information about the recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal.  
	•	IAS 39 (Amended) ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ is effective from periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014. It provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a hedging instrument to a central counter party meets specified criteria.  
	•	IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ is effective from periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018 (tentative decision by IASB). It is a new standard for financial instruments that is ultimately intended to replace IAS 39. The replacement project consists of three phases: Phase 1 Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities; Phase 2 Impairment methodology; and Phase 3 Hedge accounting.  
	•	IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’ is effective from periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014. It clarifies the timing of recognition of a liability to pay a levy recognised in accordance with IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’.  
	•	IAS 19 (Amended) ‘Employee benefits: Employee contributions’ is effective from periods commencing on or after 1 July 2014. It provides additional guidance on the accounting for contributions from employees or third parties set out in the formal terms of a defined benefit plan.  
	•	Annual Improvements 2010-2012 and Annual Improvements 2011-2013 are effective from periods commencing on or after 1 July 2014. The Annual Improvements process covers minor amendments to IFRS that the IASB consider non-urgent but necessary.  The impact on the Group’s financial statements of the future adoption of these standards is still under review.  Use of non-GAAP measures  Net debt  Net debt excludes the net debt of Tesco Bank but includes that of the discontinued operations. Net debt comprises bank and other borrowings, finance lease payables, net derivative financial instruments, joint venture loans and other receivables and net interest receivables/payables, offset by cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.  Underlying profit before tax  The Directors believe that underlying profit before tax and underlying diluted earnings per share measures provide additional useful information for shareholders on underlying trends and performance. These measures are used for performance analysis. Underlying profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies’ adjusted profit measures. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to,  IFRS measurements of profit. Tax impact on non-GAAP measures is included within Note 9.  
The adjustments made to reported profit before tax are: 
• IAS 32 and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments’ – fair value remeasurements. Under IAS 32 and IAS 39, the Group applies hedge accounting to its various hedge relationships when allowed under IAS 39 and when practical to do so. Sometimes the Group is unable to apply hedge accounting to the arrangements but continues to enter into these arrangements as they provide certainty or active management of the exchange rates and interest rates applicable to the Group. The Group believes these arrangements remain effective and economically and commercially viable hedges despite the inability to apply hedge accounting. Where hedge accounting is not applied to certain hedging arrangements, the reported results reflect the movement in fair value of related derivatives due to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates. In addition, at each year end, any gain or loss accruing on open contracts is recognised in the Group Income Statement for the financial year, regardless of the expected outcome of the hedging contract on termination. This may mean that the Group Income Statement charge is highly volatile, whilst the resulting cash flows may not be as volatile. The underlying profit measure removes this volatility to help better identify the underlying performance of the Group. 
• IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ – non-cash Group Income Statement charge for pensions. Under IAS 19, the cost of providing pension benefits in the future is discounted to a present value at the corporate bond yield rates applicable on the last day of the previous financial year. Corporate bond yield rates vary over time which in turn creates volatility in the Group Income Statement and Group Balance Sheet. IAS 19 also increases the charge for young pension schemes, such as the Group’s, by requiring the use of rates which do not take into account the future expected returns on the assets held in the pension scheme which will fund pension liabilities as they fall due. The sum of these two effects can make the IAS 19 charge disproportionately higher and more volatile than the cash contributions the Group is required to make in order to fund all future liabilities. Therefore, within underlying profit the Group has included the ‘normal’ cash contributions for pensions but excluded the volatile element of IAS 19 to represent what the Group believes to be a fairer measure of the cost of providing post-employment benefits. 
• IAS 17 ‘Leases’ – impact of annual uplifts in rent and rent-free periods. Some operating leases have been structured in a way to increase annual lease costs as the businesses expand. IAS 17 requires the total expected cost of a lease to be recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, irrespective of the actual timing of the cost. This adjustment also impacts the Group’s operating profit and rental income within the share of post-tax profits of joint ventures and associates. 
• IFRS 3 (Revised) ‘Business Combinations’ – intangible asset amortisation charges and costs arising from acquisitions. Under IFRS 3 intangible assets are separately identified and fair valued. The intangible assets are required to be amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives and as such is a non-cash charge that does not reflect the underlying performance of the business acquired. Similarly, the standard requires all acquisition costs to be expensed in the Group Income Statement. Due to their nature, these costs have been excluded from underlying profit as they do not reflect the underlying performance of the Group. 
• IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’ – fair value of awards. The interpretation requires the fair value of customer loyalty awards to be measured as a separate component of a sales transaction. The underlying profit measure removes this fair value allocation to present underlying business performance, and to reflect the performance of the operating segments as measured by management. 
• Restructuring and other one-off costs. These relate to certain costs associated with the Group’s restructuring activities and certain one-off costs including costs relating to fair valuing the assets of a disposal group. These have been excluded from underlying profit as they do not reflect the underlying performance of the Group. 
• Profits/losses from property-related items. These relate to the Group’s property activities including gains and losses on disposal of property assets, development property built for resale and property joint ventures; costs resulting from changes in the Group’s store portfolio and distribution network, including pre-opening and post closure costs; and income/ (charges) associated with impairment of non-trading property and related onerous contracts. These have been excluded from underlying profit as they do not reflect the underlying performance of the Group.

Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 2 Segmental reporting 
The Group’s reporting segments are determined based on the Group’s internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). The CODM has been determined to be the Executive Committee as it is primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments. 
The Group’s Chinese (previously reported as part of the Asia segment) and US operations have been treated as discontinued as described in more detail in Notes 1 and 7. The segment results do not include any amounts for these discontinued operations. 
The CODM considers the principal activities of the Group to be: 
• Retailingandassociatedactivitiesin: 
		−  the UK;  
		−  Asia – India, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand; and

Trading profit is a consistent measure within the Group.  Segment trading profit is an adjusted measure of operating profit and measures the performance of each segment before profits/losses arising on property- related items, the impact on leases of annual uplifts in rent and rent-free periods, intangible asset amortisation charges and costs arising from acquisitions, and goodwill impairment and restructuring and other one-off costs. The IAS 19 pension charge is replaced with the ‘normal’ cash contributions for pensions. An adjustment is also made for the fair value of customer loyalty awards.  Inter-segment revenue between the operating segments is not material.  The segment results, which do not include any amounts for discontinued operations, the reconciliation of the segment measures to the respective statutory items included in the Group Income Statement, the segment assets and other segment information are as follows:

The Finance Act 2012 included legislation to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012 and to 23% from 1 April 2013. In the December 2012 Budget Statement it was announced that the UK rate would be reduced from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and in the March 2013 Budget Statement it was announced that the rate would be further reduced to 20% by 1 April 2015. These further rate reductions were substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are therefore included in these consolidated financial statements.

No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £4.0bn (2013: £3.6bn) relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The deferred tax on unremitted earnings at 22 February 2014 is estimated to be £213m (2013: £159m) which relates to taxes payable on repatriation and dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas tax jurisdictions. UK tax legislation relating to company distributions provides for exemption from tax for most repatriated profits, subject to certain exceptions. 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
Deferred tax assets in relation to continuing operations have not been recognised in respect of the following items (because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits):

Deductible temporary differences Tax losses 
As at 22 February 2014, the Group has unused trading tax losses from continuing operations of £398m (2013: £379m) available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £95m (2013: £162m) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £303m (2013: £217m) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of £71m that will expire in 2018 (2013: £92m in 2017) and £142m that will expire between 2019 and 2034 (2013: £37m between 2018 and 2033). Other losses will be carried forward indefinitely.

Discontinued operations 
During the period, the Group entered into definitive agreements, subject to the usual regulatory approvals, with China Resources Enterprise, Limited (‘CRE’) to combine respective Chinese retail operations. The definitive agreements allow for the exchange of the Group’s Chinese retail and property interests plus cash of HK$4,325m for a 20% interest in the combined businesses. 
In the second half of the financial year, independent valuations were completed, for accounting purposes, of both businesses separately to determine the fair value of the consideration for the disposal. As a result of these valuations, the Group has concluded a charge of £540m is required to remeasure the assets and liabilities of the disposal group to the fair value less costs to sell. The valuation was completed by considering a number of different commercial valuation methodologies rather than relying on any single method. The different methodologies included discounted cash flows, enterprise value (‘EV’) / revenue multiples and income approach for Tesco and CRE businesses as appropriate. Observable and unobservable inputs have been used in the models and therefore the fair value is classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The key unobservable inputs used included discount rates (from 7.5% to 10.5%), long term growth rates (from 3.0% to 4.0%) and EV/revenue multiples (from 0.6x to 1.0x). 
IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ requires these valuations to be produced on a standalone existing basis for each business and consequently they do not incorporate the significant long term synergies and strategic value that the Directors believe exist in the new enlarged business. 
On 27 November 2013 the Group completed a sale of the substantive part of its US operations to YFE Holdings, Inc. The remaining assets of the US operation are in the process of being disposed of as part of an orderly restructuring process. In addition, the exit of the Japanese operations was successfully completed on 1 January 2013. 
The above operations have been classified as disposal groups classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’. 
The tables below show the results of the discontinued operations which are included in the Group Income Statement, Group Balance Sheet and Group Cash Flow Statement respectively.

Impairment of goodwill 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at which management monitor that goodwill. 
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections for generally five years using data from the Group’s latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market. Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing the recoverable amounts of goodwill. 
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 7% to 11% (2013: 7% to 12%). On a post-tax basis, the discount rates range from 6% to 8% (2013: 5% to 10%). These discount rates are derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each cash-generating unit. 
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates of 2% to 3% (2013: 1% to 5%). 
In February 2014 and 2013 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. 
In July 2013, the European Commission announced proposed changes in regulation which would cap interchange fees on consumer debit and credit cards. The regulation remains draft and it is unclear at this stage how and when the proposals will be finally implemented. Transaction fees on credit cards represent a significant part of the Tesco Bank business so any limitation on interchange fees may have an impact of the carrying value of goodwill for that business. Given the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the proposed changes, no change to existing interchange fees has been considered as part of goodwill impairment testing for Tesco Bank at this time. 

The components of goodwill are as follows:

Goodwill related to China was reclassified to discontinued operations in the year. 
An impairment charge of £495m was made in the previous year and arose from Poland (£373m), Czech Republic (£69m) and Turkey (£53m) CGUs (all included in the European operating segment). This loss was recognised in the cost of sales line in the Group Income Statement.

The Group continually assesses the level of services provided to tenants of its managed investment properties in accordance with IAS 40. During the year, it was concluded that the level of services provided to tenants of some malls operated by the Group are no longer considered insignificant and as a result a number of malls with a net book value of £1,623m have been reclassified from investment property to property, plant and equipment.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
    
The Group has determined that for the purposes of impairment testing, each store is a cash-generating unit. Cash-generating units are tested for impairment if there are indicators of impairment at the balance sheet date. Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based mainly on value in use but with some based on fair value less costs of disposal where it gives a higher value. 
Value in use is generally calculated from cash flow projections for five years using data from the Group’s latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board. The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term growth rates of 2% to 5% (2013: 1% to 5%). 
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market. The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 6% to 14% (2013: 7% to 12%) depending on the specific conditions in which each store operates. On a post-tax basis, the discount rates range from 6% to 12% (2013: 5% to 10%). These discount rates are derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each geographical region. 
Fair value less costs of disposal for stores was determined by reference to rental yields and residual valuation approach. 
The impairment losses relate to stores, distribution centres and work-in-progress sites. In the financial year, an impairment loss of £707m was recognised relating to properties in Europe following a reduction in profits which resulted in a revision of long-term forecast cash flows. This was classified as ‘Impairment of PPE and onerous lease provisions included within cost of sale’ within non-GAAP measures in the Group Income Statement. 
The reversal of previous impairment losses arose due to changes in fair value less costs of disposal or in forecasts resulting in increased value in use.

The estimated fair value of the Group’s investment property is £0.4bn (2013: £4.1bn). This fair value has been determined by applying an appropriate rental yield to the rentals earned by the investment property. A valuation has not been performed by an independent valuer. 
The Group continually assesses the level of services provided to tenants of its managed investment properties in accordance with IAS 40. During the year, it was concluded that the level of services provided to tenants of some malls operated by the Group are no longer considered insignificant and as a result a number of malls with a net book value of £1,623m have been reclassified from investment property to property, plant and equipment.

98 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Note 21 Financial instruments 
Derivatives are used to hedge exposure to market risks and those that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39. Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes and the Group’s hedging policies are further described below. 
Net finance cost of £22m (2013: £19m) resulted from hedge ineffectiveness. 
Fair value hedges 
The Group maintains interest rate and cross currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt issued by the Group. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group Income Statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument and hedged item is recognised in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item is amortised to the Group Income Statement. 
A loss of £311m on hedging instruments was recognised during the year, offset by a gain of £282m on hedged items (2013: a gain of £52m on hedging instruments was offset by a loss of £65m on hedged items). 
Cash flow hedges 
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company. Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, fair value gains and losses are deferred in equity. These hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US Dollars. The cash flows hedged will occur and will affect the Group Income Statement within one year of the balance sheet date. 
The Group also uses index-linked swaps to hedge cash flows on index linked debt, interest rate swaps to hedge interest cash flows on debt and cross currency swaps to hedge cash flows on fixed rate debt denominated in foreign currencies. 
Net investment hedges 
The Group uses currency denominated borrowings and currency swaps to hedge the exposure of a portion of its net investment in overseas operations against changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. A net finance income of £7m (2013: a net finance cost of £6m) was recorded resulting from net investment hedging ineffectiveness. 
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are recycled to the Group Income Statement on disposal of overseas operations. 
Financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting 
The Group’s policy does not permit use of derivatives for trading purposes. However, some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where gains and losses on the hedging instrument and the hedged item naturally offset in the Group Income Statement. 
These instruments include cross currency interest rate swaps, index linked swaps and forward foreign currency contracts. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs. 
 
The fair values of derivative financial instruments have been disclosed in the Group Balance Sheet as follows:

Note 21 Financial instruments continued 
The fair values of financial instruments and derivatives have been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which the instruments are traded, where they are available. Where market prices are not available, the fair value has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates. The above tables exclude other receivables/payables, which have fair values equal to their carrying values. 
 
Financial assets and liabilities by category 
The accounting classifications of each class of financial assets and liabilities as at 22 February 2014 and 23 February 2013 are as follows:

Fair value measurement 
The following table presents the Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 22 February 2014, by level of fair value hierarchy: 
	•	quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);  
	•	inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is,  

derived from prices) (Level 2); and • inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3).

For the financial assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting arrangements above, each agreement between the Group and the counterparty allows for net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities when both elect to settle on a net basis. In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis, however each party to the master netting agreement or similar agreements will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party. 
 
Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 103 
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 
Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 22 Financial risk factors 
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions and the availability of funds to meet business needs. The management of these risks is set out below. 
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Board provides written principles for risk management, as described in the Principal risks and uncertainties on pages 20 to 25. 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Debt issued at variable rates as well as cash deposits and short-term investments exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Debt issued at fixed rates exposes the Group to fair value risk. The Group’s interest rate management policy is explained on page 25. 
The Group has Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) debt where the principal is indexed to increases in the RPI. RPI debt is treated as floating rate debt. The Group also has Limited Price lnflation (‘LPI’) debt, where the principal is indexed to RPI, with an annual maximum increase of 5% and a minimum of 0%. LPI debt is treated as fixed rate debt. 
For interest rate risk relating to Tesco Bank, refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors on page 107. During 2014 and 2013, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows:

Credit risk 
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, customer deposits, financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions. The Group policy on credit risk is described on page 25. 
The net counterparty exposure under derivative contracts is £1.2bn (2013: £1.7bn). The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be £13.3bn (2013: £11.9bn) being the Group’s total financial assets. 
For credit risk relating to Tesco Bank, refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors on page 107. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is managed by short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts. In addition, the Group has committed facility agreements for £2.7bn (2013: £2.8bn), which mature between 2015 and 2018. 
The Group has a European Medium Term Note programme of £15.0bn, of which £7.0bn was in issue at 22 February 2014 (2013: £6.2bn), plus a Euro Commercial Paper programme of £2.0bn, none of which was in issue at 22 February 2014 (2013: £0.1bn), and a US Commercial Paper programme of $4.0bn, £nil of which was in issue at 22 February 2014 (2013: £0.1bn). 
On 5 November 2013 the Group issued €1.0bn of long-term debt and on 27 January 2014 the Group repaid ¥31.5bn of long-term debt. For liquidity risk relating to Tesco Bank, refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors on page 107. 

104 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Note 22 Financial risk factors continued 
The following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivatives. The potential cash outflow of £18.2bn is considered acceptable as it is offset by financial assets and trade receivables of £14.8bn (2013: £17.4bn offset by financial assets and trade receivables of £14.4bn). 
The undiscounted cash flows will differ from both the carrying values and fair value. Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing rate at the balance sheet date. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date. For index-linked liabilities, inflation is 
 
estimated at 3% for the life of the liability.

Foreign exchange risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk principally via: 
 
	•	Transactional exposure that arises from the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company. Transactional exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged. These exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges. The notional and fair value of these contracts is shown in Note 21.  
	•	NetinvestmentexposurethatarisesfromchangesinthevalueofnetinvestmentsdenominatedincurrenciesotherthanPoundsSterling.TheGroup hedges a part of its investments in its international subsidiaries via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies which are formally designated as net investment hedges.

The impact on Group financial statements from foreign currency volatility is shown in the sensitivity analysis below: 
Sensitivity analysis 
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-employment obligations and on the retranslation of overseas net assets as required by IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’. However, it does include the foreign exchange sensitivity resulting from all local entity non-functional currency financial instruments. 
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 22 February 2014. It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due to all financial instruments held at the balance sheet date. It does not reflect any change in sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates. 
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: 
	•	the sensitivity of interest payable to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments with no sensitivity assumed for RPI-linked debt which has been swapped to fixed rates;  
	•	changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates or foreign exchange rates have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt;  
	•	changesinthecarryingvalueofderivativefinancialinstrumentsdesignatedasnetinvestmenthedgesfrommovementsinforeignexchangeratesare recorded directly in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income;  
	•	changesinthecarryingvalueofderivativefinancialinstrumentsnotdesignatedashedginginstrumentsonlyaffecttheGroupIncomeStatement;  
	•	allotherchangesinthecarryingvalueofderivativefinancialinstrumentsdesignatedashedginginstrumentsarefullyeffectivewithnoimpact  on the Group Income Statement; and  
	•	the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects a full  12-month period for the interest payable portion of the sensitivity calculations.  Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Income Statement and equity that would result, at the balance sheet date, from changes in UK interest rates and currency exchange rates that are reasonably possible for major currencies where there have recently been significant movements:

A decrease in interest rates and a depreciation of foreign currencies would have the opposite effect to the impact in the table above. 
The impact on the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income from changing exchange rates results from the revaluation of financial liabilities used as net investment hedges. The impact on the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income will largely be offset by the revaluation in equity of the hedged assets. 
Capital risk 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital (defined as net debt plus equity) are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while maintaining a strong credit rating and headroom whilst optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group. 
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, buy back shares and cancel them, or issue new shares. 
– 
– 
– 
The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, disposals of property assets including sale and leaseback transactions, debt capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases to ensure continuity of funding. The policy for debt is to ensure a smooth debt maturity profile with the objective of ensuring continuity of funding. This policy continued during the financial year with bonds redeemed of £208m (2013: £1,285m) and £844m of new bonds issued (2013: £nil). The Group borrows centrally and locally, using a variety of capital market instruments and borrowing facilities to meet the Group’s business requirements of each local business. 
Refer to Note 30 for the value of the Group’s net debt (£6.6bn; 2013: £6.6bn), and the Group Statement of Changes in Equity for the value of the Group’s equity (£14.7bn; 2013: £16.7bn). 

106 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Note 22 Financial risk factors continued 
Tesco Bank Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises where assets and liabilities in Tesco Bank’s banking activities have different repricing dates. Tesco Bank policy seeks to minimise the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates. Potential exposures to interest rate movements in the medium to long-term are measured and controlled through position and sensitivity limits. Short-term exposures are measured and controlled in terms of net interest income sensitivity over 12 months to a 1% parallel movement in interest rates. Tesco Bank also use Economic Value Equity (‘EVE’) for risk management purposes with focus on the value of Tesco Bank in today’s interest rate environment and its sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed using interest rate swaps as the main hedging instrument. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that Tesco Bank is unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due. Liquidity risk is managed within Tesco Bank’s banking activities and adheres to the liquidity requirements set by the Prudential Regulation Authority (‘PRA’). Tesco Bank’s Board has set a defined liquidity risk policy and contingency funding which is prudent and in excess of the minimum requirements as set out by the PRA and by Tesco Bank. A diversified portfolio of high-quality liquid and marketable assets is maintained. Cash flow commitments and marketable asset holdings are measured and managed on a daily basis. Tesco Bank has sufficient liquidity to meet all foreseeable outflow requirements as they fall due and its liquidity risk is further mitigated by its well diversified retail deposit base and a pool of surplus cash resources that are invested in a range of marketable assets. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the potential that a bank borrower or counterparty will fail to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms. Credit risk principally arises from the Bank’s retail lending activities but also from the placement of surplus funds with other banks and money market funds, investments in transferable securities and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives. In addition, credit risk arises from contractual arrangements with third parties where payments and commissions are due to the Bank for short periods of time. 
Retail credit policy is managed through the credit risk policy framework with standards and limits defined at all stages of the customer lifecycle, including new account sanctioning, customer management and collections and recovery activity. Customer lending decisions are managed principally through the deployment of bespoke credit scorecard models and credit policy rules, which exclude specific areas of lending, and an affordability assessment which determines a customer’s ability to repay an outstanding credit amount. Wholesale credit risk is managed using a limit-based framework, with limits determined by counterparty credit worthiness, instrument type and remaining tenor. A limits framework is also in place for the management of third party credit exposures. 
Ineffective management and controls over the emerging asset quality of the Group’s lending portfolios could expose the Group to unacceptable levels of bad debt. The Group’s asset quality is reflected through the level of its impairment by lending type. Asset quality profiles are regularly monitored and reported to the appropriate senior management team and risk committees. 
The table below presents an analysis of credit exposure by impairment status across the different exposure classes. The table predominantly relates to banking assets; the retail instalment lending applies to credit agreements in the insurance business.

Insurance risk 

Tesco Bank is indirectly exposed to insurance risks through its ownership of 49.9% of Tesco Underwriting Limited (‘TU’), an authorised insurance company. Since late 2010 the majority of new business policies for home and motor insurance products sold by Tesco Bank have been underwritten by TU. The key insurance risks within TU relate to underwriting risk and specifically the potential for a major weather event to generate significant claims on home insurance or on motor insurance the cost of settling bodily injury claims. Exposure to this risk is actively managed within TU with close monitoring of performance metrics and the use of reinsurance to limit TU’s exposure above predetermined limits.

Property provisions comprise obligations for future rents payable net of rents receivable on onerous leases including on vacant property and unprofitable stores, terminal dilapidations and other onerous contracts relating to property. The majority of these provisions are expected to be utilised over the period to 2020. 
The other provisions balances relate mainly to provisions for Tesco Bank customer redress in respect of potential complaints arising from the historic sales of Payment Protection Insurance (‘PPI’), in respect of customer redress relating to the historic sale of certain cardholder protection products (‘CPP’) and in respect of certain classes of loans and credit cards sold by the Group which are regulated under the Consumer Credit Act (‘CCA’). The Group has identified instances where the technical requirement for the provision of certain post-contractual documentation to customers with CCA-regulated products has not been fully met. While there is no evidence that these issues have caused particular detriment to customers, it is the Group’s intention to provide redress to impacted customers in order to reflect the operation of the CCA in respect of the customers’ liability. These provisions may be used over several years although the timing of utilisation is uncertain. The balance is classified as current at the year end.

Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 25 Share-based payments 
For continuing operations, the Group Income Statement charge for the year recognised in respect of share-based payments is £82m (2013: £89m), which is made up of share option schemes and share bonus payments. Of this amount, £63m (2013: £65m) will be settled in equity and £19m (2013: £24m) in cash. 
Share option schemes 
The Company had ten share option schemes in operation during the financial year, all of which are equity-settled schemes: 
i) The Savings-related Share Option Scheme (1981) permits the grant to colleagues of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building society/bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from colleagues of an amount between £5 and £250 per four-weekly period. Options are capable of being exercised at the end of the three or five-year period at a subscription price of not less than 80% of the average of the middle- market quotations of an ordinary share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the offer date. 
ii) The Irish Savings-related Share Option Scheme (2000) permits the grant to Irish colleagues of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building society/bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from colleagues of an amount between €12 and €500 per four-weekly period. Options are capable of being exercised at the end of the three or five-year period at a subscription price of not less than 80% of the average of the middle-market quotations of an ordinary share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the offer date. 
iii) The Approved Executive Share Option Scheme (1994) was adopted on 17 October 1994. The exercise of options granted under this scheme will normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year period. No further options will be granted under this scheme and it has been replaced by the Discretionary Share Option Plan (2004). There were no discounted options granted under this scheme. 
iv) The Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme (1996) was adopted on 7 June 1996. The exercise of options granted under this scheme will normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year period. No further options will be granted under this scheme and it has been replaced by the Discretionary Share Option Plan (2004). There were no discounted options granted under this scheme. 
v) The International Executive Share Option Scheme (1994) was adopted on 20 May 1994. This scheme permits the grant to selected non-UK executives of options to acquire ordinary shares on substantially the same basis as their UK counterparts. The exercise of options granted under this scheme will normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year period. No further options will be granted under this scheme and it has been replaced by the Discretionary Share Option Plan (2004). There were no discounted options granted under this scheme. 
vi) The Executive Incentive Plan (2004) was adopted on 5 July 2004. This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares to selected senior executives. Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration. Full details of this plan can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
vii) The Performance Share Plan (2004) was adopted on 5 July 2004 and amended on 29 June 2007. This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives. Options granted before 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between four and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration. Options granted after 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration. The exercise of options will normally be conditional upon the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed over a three-year period. No further options will be granted under this scheme and it has been replaced by the Performance Share Plan (2011). 
viii) The Performance Share Plan (2011) was adopted on 1 July 2011 and amended on 4 July 2011. This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives. Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration. The exercise of options will normally be conditional upon the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed and earnings per share over a three-year period.

Note 25 Share-based payments continued 
ix) The Discretionary Share Option Plan (2004) was adopted on 5 July 2004. This scheme permits the grant of approved, unapproved and international options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives. Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant at a price not less than the middle-market quotation or average middle-market quotations of an ordinary share for the dealing day or three dealing days preceding the date of grant. The exercise of options will normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the annual percentage growth in earnings per share over a three-year period. There were no discounted options granted under this scheme. 
x) The Group New Business Incentive Plan (2007) was adopted on 29 June 2007. This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives. Options will normally vest in four tranches: four, five, six and seven years after the date of grant and will be exercisable for up to two years from the vesting dates for nil consideration. The exercise of options will normally be conditional upon the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed over the seven-year plan.

Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a price is expected to fluctuate during a period. The measure of volatility used in the models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a period of time. In volatility of the Company’s share price, the Board considers the historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally commensurate with the expected term of the option, taking into account the remaining contractual life of the option. 
Share bonus schemes 
Eligible UK colleagues are able to participate in Shares In Success, an all-employee profit-sharing scheme. Each year, shares may be awarded to colleagues as a percentage of earnings, up to a statutory maximum of £3,000 per annum. Eligible Republic of Ireland colleagues are able to participate in a Share Bonus Scheme, an all-employee profit-sharing scheme. Each year, colleagues receive an award of either cash or shares based on a percentage of their earnings. 
Selected executives participate in the Group Bonus Plan, a performance-related bonus scheme. The amount paid to colleagues is based on a percentage of salary and is paid partly in cash and partly in shares. Bonuses are awarded to selected executives who have completed a required service period and depend on the achievement of corporate targets. 
Selected senior executives participate in the Management Performance Share Plan. Awards made under this plan will normally vest three years after the date of the award for nil consideration. Vesting will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed over a three-year performance period. No further awards will be granted under this scheme and it has been replaced by the Performance Share Plan (2011). 
Selected executives participate in the Performance Share Plan (2011). Awards made under this plan will normally vest three years after the date of the award for nil consideration. Vesting will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed and earnings per share over a three-year performance period. 
Selected executives also participate in the US Long-Term Incentive Plan (2007), which was adopted on 29 June 2007. The awards made under this plan will normally vest in four tranches: four, five, six and seven years after the date of award, for nil consideration. 
The Executive Directors participate in short-term and long-term bonus schemes designed to align their interests with those of shareholders. Full details of these schemes can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
The fair value of shares awarded under these schemes is their market value on the date of award. Expected dividends are not incorporated into the fair value except for awards under the US Long-Term Incentive Plan.

Pensions 

The Group operates a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements, covering both funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes and funded defined contribution schemes. The most significant of these are the funded defined benefit pension schemes for the Group’s employees in the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Thailand and South Korea. Of these schemes, the UK represents 95% of the defined benefit obligation (2013: 95%). 
Defined contribution plans 
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of £32m (2013: £19m) have been recognised in the Group Income Statement.

Defined benefit plans 
United Kingdom 
The principal plan within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’), which is a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the assets of which are held as a segregated fund and administered by the Trustee. 
The Scheme is established under trust law and has a corporate trustee that is required to run the Scheme in accordance with the Scheme’s Trust Deed and Rules and to comply with the Pension Scheme Act 1993, Pensions Act 1995, Pensions Act 2004 and all the relevant legislation. Responsibility for governance of the Scheme lies with the Trustee. The Trustee is a company whose directors comprise of: 
i) representatives of the Group; and ii) the Scheme participants, in accordance with its articles of association and UK pension law. 
All members are eligible to join the Career Average section of the Scheme (‘Pension Builder’), where benefits are based on a member’s salary and their length of service. There is a Final Salary section of the Scheme which was closed to new entrants in 2001. 
Towers Watson Limited, an independent actuary, carried out the latest triennial actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 31 March 2011, using the projected unit method. 
At 31 March 2011, the actuarial deficit was £934m. The market value of the schemes’ assets was £5,587m and these assets represented 86% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in earnings and pensions in payment. 
  
The scheme has a duration of 22 years. 
Scheme Liabilities as at 31 March 2011

Overseas 
The most significant overseas schemes are the funded defined benefit schemes which operate in the Republic of Ireland, Thailand and South Korea. An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the Republic of Ireland scheme as at 1 April 2010, Thailand as at 23 February 2013 and South Korea as at 22 February 2014. 
The valuations used for IAS 19 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Towers Watson Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 22 February 2014. The schemes’ assets are stated at their market values as at 22 February 2014. Towers Watson Limited have updated the most recent Republic of Ireland, Thailand and South Korea valuations. The liabilities relating to retirement healthcare benefits have also been determined in accordance with IAS 19.

UK mortality assumptions 
The Group conducts analysis of mortality trends under the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme in the UK as part of the triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme. At the latest triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2011 the following assumptions were adopted for funding purposes: 
Base tables: 90% of the SAPS normal male pensioners for male staff and 80% of the SAPS all male pensioners light for male senior managers. 105% of the SAPS normal female pensioners for female staff and 90% for female senior managers. 
These assumptions were used for the calculation of the pension liability as at 22 February 2014 for the main UK scheme.

Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 26 Post-employment benefits continued 
The mortality assumptions used are based on tables that have been projected to 2009 with long cohort improvements. In addition, the allowance for future mortality improvements from 2009 is in line with medium cohort projections with a minimum annual improvement of 1% per annum. 
The following table illustrates the expectation of life of an average member retiring at age 65 at the reporting date and a member reaching age 65 at reporting date +25 years.

Risks 
The Group bears a numbers of risks in relation to the Scheme, which are described below: 
2014 2013 Years Years 22.8 24.3 25.2 26.5 
Investment risk – The Scheme’s IAS 19 liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If the return on the Scheme’s assets underperform this rate, the IAS 19 deficit will increase. The Trustee and the Group regularly monitor the funding position and operate a diversified investment strategy. 
Inflation risk – The Scheme’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation therefore higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. This will be partially offset by an increase in any Scheme assets that are linked to, or correlate with, inflation. Changes to future benefits were introduced in June 2012 to reduce the Scheme’s exposure to inflation risk by changing the basis for calculating the rate of increase in pensions to CPI (previously RPI). 
Changes in bond yields – A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Scheme’s liabilities. However, this may be partially offset by an increase in the capital value of the Scheme’s assets that have similar characteristics. 
Life expectancy risk – The Scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member and so increases in life expectancy will lead to higher liabilities. To reduce this risk, changes to future benefits were introduced in June 2012 to increase the age at which members can take their full pension by two years. Furthermore the Group has the ability to change this in the future if there are further unexpected changes in life expectancy. 
An Audit & Risk Pensions Committee was established to further strengthen our Trustee Governance and provide greater oversight and stronger internal control over our risks. Further mitigation of the risks is provided by external advisors and the Trustee who consider the funding position, fund performance, and impacts of any regulatory changes. 
A different approach is used to calculate the triennial actuarial liabilities and the IAS 19 liabilities. The key difference is that IAS 19 requires the discount rate to be set using corporate bonds whilst the actuarial liabilities discount rate is based on expected returns of Scheme assets. 
Sensitivity analysis of significant actuarial assumptions 
Change in UK defined benefit obligation from a 0.1% increase in discount rate Increase in UK defined benefit obligation from a 1% increase in pensions in payment Increase in UK defined benefit obligation from a 1% increase in salary growth Increase in UK defined benefit obligation from each additional year of longevity assumed

The method and assumptions used to determine sensitivity and their limitation is the effect of varying the assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant.

Net debt excludes the net debt of Tesco Bank but includes that of the discontinued operations. Movements and balances related to Tesco Bank are included within this analysis and the Reconciliation of net cash flow to movement in net debt note to allow reconciliation between the Group Balance Sheet and the Group Cash Flow Statement. These movements and balances relating to Tesco Bank are subsequently eliminated to arrive at closing net debt. 
Note 31 Business combinations and other acquisitions 
During the current financial year, the Group completed business combination transactions with total cash consideration of £49m (2013: £30m), which are not considered material to the Group individually or in aggregate.

Note 32 Commitments and contingencies 
Capital commitments 
At 22 February 2014, there were commitments for capital expenditure contracted for, but not provided for of £270m (2013: £1,278m), principally relating to store development. 
Contingent liabilities 
Tesco PLC has irrevocably guaranteed the liabilities of the following Irish subsidiary undertakings for the financial year ended 22 February 2014, which undertakings have been exempted pursuant to Section 17(1) of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 of Ireland from the provisions of Section 7 (other than subsection (1)(b)) of that Act: 
Monread Developments Limited; Edson Properties Limited; Edson Investments Limited; Cirrus Finance (2009) Limited; Commercial Investments Limited; Chirac Limited; Clondalkin Properties Limited; Golden Island Management Services Limited; Tesco Ireland Pension Trustees Limited; Orpingford; Tesco Trustee Company of Ireland Limited; WSC Properties Limited, Thundridge; Pharaway Properties Limited; R.J.D. Holdings; Nabola Development Limited; PEJ Property Investments Limited; Cirrus Finance Limited; Tesco Ireland Limited; Wanze Properties (Dundalk) Limited; Valiant Insurance Company; Tesco Ireland Holdings Limited. 
For details of assets held under finance leases, which are pledged as security for the finance lease liabilities, see Note 11. There are a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business which if realised are not expected to result in a material liability to the Group. The Group recognises provisions for liabilities when it is more likely than not that a settlement will be required and the value of such a payment can be reliably estimated. 
Tesco Bank 
At 22 February 2014, Tesco Bank had commitments of formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend, totalling £9.7bn (2013: £8.0bn). The amount is intended to provide an indication of the potential volume of business and not of the underlying credit or other risks. 
During the year to 22 February 2014 a change was made to a methodology by which the Group measures undrawn credit card commitments to exclude both the credit limits on cancelled cards and any overpayments made by customers. The impact of this change in the prior year is a reduction in undrawn credit card commitments of £0.5bn. 
Note 33 Tesco Bank capital resources

Following the publication of the Capital Requirements Directive (‘CRD’) IV rules in the year, the Prudential Regulation Authority (‘PRA’) issued a policy statement on 19 December 2013 detailing how the rules will be enacted within the UK with corresponding timeframes for implementation. The CRD IV rules will be phased in over the course of the next five years.

for the year to which they relate. The 2013 capital resources have been represented on a consistent basis with the current year presentation. Previously, annual profits were only included within capital resources at the point at which they were deemed verified by the Group’s auditors. 
It is TPF’s policy to maintain a strong capital base, to expand it as appropriate and to utilise it efficiently throughout its activities to optimise the return to shareholders while maintaining a prudent relationship between the capital base and the underlying risks of the business. In carrying out this policy, TPF has regard to the supervisory requirements of the PRA.

Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases associated with the discontinued operations in China are excluded from the 2014 figures in the above tables (2013: £1,633m). See Note 7 for further details on discontinued operations. 
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its retail, distribution and office properties and other assets such as motor vehicles. The leases have varying terms, purchase options, escalation clauses and renewal rights. Purchase options and renewal rights, where they occur, are at market value. Escalation clauses are in line with market practices and include inflation linked, fixed rates, resets to market rents and hybrids of these. 
The Group has lease break options on certain sale and leaseback transactions, which are exercisable if an existing option to buy back leased assets at market value at a specified date is also exercised. No commitment has been included in respect of the buy-back option as the option is at the Group’s discretion. The Group is not obliged to pay lease rentals after that date, therefore minimum lease payments exclude those falling after the buy-back date. The current market value of these properties is £5.4bn (2013: £5.2bn) and the total lease rentals, if they were to be incurred following the option exercise date, would be £4.2bn (2013: £4.1bn) using current rent values. 
Operating lease commitments with joint ventures and associates 
Since 1988 the Group has entered into several joint ventures and associates and sold and leased back properties to and from these joint ventures and associates. The Group entered into a property sale and leaseback transaction with an associate in this financial year. The terms of these sale and leasebacks vary, however, common factors include: the sale of the properties to the joint venture or associate at market value; options within the lease for the Group to repurchase the properties at market value; market rent reviews; and 20 to 30 full-year lease terms. The Group reviews the substance as well as the form of the arrangements when determining the classification of leases as operating or finance. All of the leases under these arrangements are operating leases. 
Operating lease receivables – Group as lessor 
The Group both rents out its properties and also sublets various leased buildings under operating leases. At the balance sheet date, the following future 
minimum lease payments are contractually receivable from tenants: 
Within one year Greater than one year but less than five years After five years Total minimum lease receivables

On 21 March 2014, the Group entered into an agreement with Trent Limited, part of the Tata Group, to form a 50:50 Joint Venture in Trent Hypermarket Limited (‘THL’) which operates the Star Bazaar retail business in India. The Group’s investment is £85 million. 
On 2 April 2014 the Group, through its subsidiary Dunnhumby Limited, acquired Sociomantic Labs (‘Sociomantic’), a Berlin-based global leader in digital advertising solutions, for £124m. Sociomantic operates in 14 countries worldwide, with clients in retail, financial services and travel services.

122 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Notes to the Parent Company financial statements 
Note 1 Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The Parent Company financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention modified for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (‘UK GAAP’) and the Companies Act 2006. 
The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 22 February 2014 (prior financial year 52 weeks to 23 February 2013). 
A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is set out below. 
Exemptions 
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented a Profit and Loss Account for the Company alone. 
The Company has taken advantage of the FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ exemption and not provided derivative financial instrument disclosures of the Company alone. 
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a Cash Flow Statement under the terms of FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow Statement’. The cash flows of the Company are included in the Tesco Group financial statements. 
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 ‘Related Parties’ from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the Tesco Group. 
Short-term investments 
Short-term investments relate to money market deposits which are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost. All income from these investments is included in the Profit and Loss Account as interest receivable and similar income. 
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures 
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. 
Foreign currencies 
Assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Pounds Sterling at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date of the financial year. 
Share-based payments 
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes model. The resulting cost is charged to the Profit and Loss Account over the vesting period. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting. 
Where the Company awards shares or options to employees of subsidiary entities, this is treated as a capital contribution. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s Balance Sheet when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Debtors 
Debtors are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at the value of the amount received, net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any differences between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Company Profit and Loss Account over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. 
Other creditors 
Other creditors are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operating, financing and investing activities. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on remeasurement are immediately recognised in the Company Profit and Loss Account. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the items being hedged. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company is required to document from inception, the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument. The Company is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis. This effectiveness testing is performed at each reporting date to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective. 
Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of more than one year from the balance sheet date are disclosed as falling due after more than one year. 
    
Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 123 
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 
Notes to the Parent Company financial statements continued Note 1 Accounting policies continued 

Fair value hedging 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Company Profit and Loss Account, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
Cash flow hedging 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Company’s exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction. 
The effective element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in equity. 
The associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the Company Profit and Loss Account in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects the Company Profit and Loss Account. The classification of the effective portion when recognised in the Company Profit and Loss Account is the same as the classification of the hedged transaction. Any element of the re-measurement criteria of the derivative instrument which does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the Company Profit and Loss Account. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or is de-designated. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs or the original hedged item affects the Company Profit and Loss Account. If a forecasted hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the Company Profit and Loss Account. 
Pensions 
The Company participates in the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme and cannot identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme. Accordingly, as permitted by FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’, the Company has accounted for the scheme as a defined contribution scheme, and the charge for the period is based upon the cash contributions payable. 
Taxation 
Corporation tax payable is provided on the taxable profit for the year, using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. 
The company will surrender group relief to Group companies and consequently there may be no tax charge in the Profit and Loss Account. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date and would give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are recoverable. They are regarded as recoverable to the extent that on the basis of all available evidence, it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discontinued basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.

The £991m impairment relates to the Company’s investments in the Group’s Chinese retail operations. During the period, the Group entered into definitive agreements with China Resources Enterprise, Limited to combine their respective Chinese retail operations. The definitive agreements allow for the exchange of the Group’s Chinese retail and property interests plus cash of HK$4,325m for a 20% interest in the combined businesses. Consequently, the Directors have written-down the Company’s investments in China to the value consolidated in the Group financial statements, which reflects the fair value for disposal. Please refer to Note 7 in the Group financial statements for further details.

130 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Tesco PLC 
Report on the Parent Company financial statements Our opinion 
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements, defined below: 
	•	give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 22 February 2014;  
	•	have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and  
	•	have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.  This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.  What we have audited  The parent Company financial statements, which are prepared by Tesco PLC, comprise: 
	•	the Parent Company Balance Sheet as at 22 February 2014; and  
	•	the notes to the Parent Company financial statements, which  include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.  The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).  In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future events.  Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report and Financial Statements (the “Annual Report”) rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.  What an audit of financial statements involves  We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK & Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:  
	•	whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;  
	•	thereasonablenessofsignificantaccountingestimatesmadeby the directors; and  
	•	the overall presentation of the financial statements.  In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited Parent Company financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.  Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  In our opinion:  
	•	the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Parent Company financial statements are prepared is consistent with the Parent Company financial statements; and  
	•	the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law have not been made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Other information in the Annual Report 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Parent Company financial statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Parent Company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
• is otherwise misleading. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Our responsibilities and those of the directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 64, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Other Matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Tesco PLC for the 52 weeks ended 22 February 2014.
