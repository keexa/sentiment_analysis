Notes to the financial statements1. General InformationThe Consolidated Financial Statements (“the Financial Statements”) of Globo Plc (“the Company”) consist of the following companies: Globo Plc, Profitel Communications S.A., Globo Mobile S.A., Reach Further Communications Limited, Globo Holdings Limited, GMIP Limited, Globo Services (CY) Limited, Globo EMEA Holdings Limited, Globo Mobile Technologies International FZ – LLP, Globo International LLC, Globo US Holdings LLC, Globo Mobile Inc, and Globo Mobile Technologies Inc (collectively, “the Group”).The registered office address is 190 High Street, Tonbridge, Kent TN10 4EB.2. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Financial Statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.(a) Basis of PreparationThe Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”), IFRIC interpretations and the parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the measurement of investments in associates and contingent consideration at fair value.The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial information, including the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.The financial statements of the Company and Group are presented in Euros and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (€000), except as otherwise stated.Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2013(i) New and amended standards adopted by the GroupA number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for the annual period beginning after 1 January 2013 and have been applied in preparing these financial statements.Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’ regarding items of other comprehensive income became effective during the period. Items in the consolidated statement of total comprehensive income that may be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods are now presented separately from items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.IFRS 13, “Fair value measurement” became effective during the period. The standard defines fair value and provides a framework for fair value measurement. In addition the standard requires specific disclosures on fair values, some of which replace existing disclosure requirements in IFRS 7, “Financial instruments: Disclosures”. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximate to their book values due to the short maturity periods of these financial instruments. Available for sale financial assets consist of equity investments whose fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices (level 1 in the fair value measurement hierarchy).(ii) New and amended standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2013 and not early adoptedA number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2013, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below:
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – effective date pending• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009, October 2010 and November 2013. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact. The Group will also consider the impact of the remaining phases of IFRS 9 when completed by the International Accountings Standards Board.• IAS 27, ‘Separate Financial Statements’, replaces the current version of IAS 27, ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ as a result of the issue of IFRS 10. The revised standard includes the requirements relating to separate financial statements. The revised standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.• IAS 28, ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’, replaces the current version of IAS 28,’Investments in Associates’, as a result of the issue of IFRS 11. The revised standard includes the requirements for associates and joint ventures that have to be equity accounted following the issue of IFRS 1. The Group is yet to assess full impact of the revised standard and intends to adopt IAS 28 (revised) no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.• IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’, builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 10’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 10 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.• IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’, includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off Statement of Financial Position vehicles. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 12’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 12 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.(b) Basis of ConsolidationBusiness CombinationsThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) forming the Group.Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating activities, generally accompanied by a shareholding equal to more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Company controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases.Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date61
Notes to the financial statementsof exchange. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments.Investment in an associateThe Group’s investment in its associate, an entity in which the Group has significant influence, is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is initially recognised at cost and the carrying amount is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of the profit or loss of the associate since the acquisition date.The Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate is shown on the face of the Income Statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of associates’ in the statement of total comprehensive income.Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and its associate are recognised in the Group’s Financial Statements only to the extent of unrelated investor’s interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.(c) Going ConcernThe Financial Statements are prepared under the going concern assumption.The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive Officer’s Report. The financial position of the Group and Company, their cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review. In addition, notes 3 and 39 to the Financial Statements includes the Group’s and Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing their capital; their financial risk management objectives; details of their financial instruments and exposure to credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Company raised £24.1 million before expenses to support the working capital requirements of the Group and fund product development and further international expansion. The Group currently has considerable financial resources together with long term contracts with a number of customers and suppliers across different product lines and geographic areas. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business and financial risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic climate and competitive market conditions. The Group also retains banking and loan note facilities through long term borrowings (a long term loan facility of €35m plus a €10 million extension from Barclays Bank Plc and East West United Bank is already in place) and, together with the new funds raised from investors, continue with the development of software platforms and international development.The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate with the cash funds and existing bank and loan note borrowings.The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements.(d) Measurement CurrencyItems included in the Financial Statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its “functional currency”). The Financial Statements are presented in Euros (€), which is the Group’s presentational currency. The Financial Statements of the parent undertaking, whose functional currency is pounds sterling, have been translated and stated in Euros in order for there to be consistency with the Group.(e) Foreign Currency TranslationTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are accounted for at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences on retranslation and settlement are recognised in profit or loss. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:• Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;• Income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates; and• All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss.Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.63
Notes to the financial statements(f) Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment, comprising land, property, vehicles and furniture and fittings, are recorded at historical cost less depreciation and impairment losses.Property plant and equipment is depreciated on the straight line method over the expected useful life of the assets, as follows:AssetPropertyOffice furniture and fittings VehiclesUseful life33 years 6 years 9 yearsGains and losses on disposal, determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount of the respective assets, are included in operating profit within other operating income.All maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of any tangible asset is assessed and is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.(g) Intangible AssetsIntangible assets that are acquired or developed by the Group are carried at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.Interest costs on borrowings not directly attributable to software development costs are not capitalised but are instead recognised in profit or loss during the period.Software and LicencesResearch expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Costs incurred on development projects (relating to the design and testing of new and improved products) are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and only if the cost can be reliably measured. Other development expenditures are recognised as an expense, as they are incurred.Costs incurred on development projects are recognised as intangible assets only if all of the following conditions are met:• it is technically feasible to complete the product so that it will be available for use or sale;• it is the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;• there is an ability to use or sell the intangible asset;• it can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
• adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available; and• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be reliably measured.Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Licences include development costs comprising the direct staff costs of the software development team incurred in the development of software products and third party development costs of software libraries and modules, incorporated into the Group’s products. The Group continues to capitalise costs incurred on newly developed until the products are ready for use and sale at which point the costs will be amortised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. The Group will also capitalise certain development expenditures on available for use intangible assets when there is a clear future economic benefit. This includes any development that would enhance functionality and extend the life of existing assets. The Group expenses any basic maintenance costs in the period in which they are incurred.Development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the commencement of the commercial availability of the product on a straight-line basis over its expected benefit period of between three and five years. Licenses are amortised over the shorter of the contract term of the license agreement and the useful life of the asset which does not exceed a four year period.Computer Software CostsComputer software costs generally represent costs incurred to purchase software programmes and packages that are used both internally and to develop and ultimately sell the Group’s products. Generally, costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. However, costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, which have probable economic benefit beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include staff costs of the software development team as well as the cost of subcontractors. All other overheads are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.Expenditure which enhances or extends the performance of computer software programmes beyond their original specifications is recognised as a capital improvement and added to the original cost of the software. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their useful lives, not exceeding a period of four years.Costs associated with the maintenance of existing computer software programmes are expensed as incurred.(h) Impairment of Non-Current Assets other than goodwillThe carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill, is reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine if there is any indication of impairment. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss when the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.A previously recognised impairment loss will be reversed in so far as estimates change, but not to an amount higher than the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income.65
Notes to the financial statements(i) LeasesA finance lease is one in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. Assets obtained under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the shorter of the useful economic life and the term of the lease. The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to profit or loss over the period of the lease, and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.The Group has finance lease obligations relating to vehicles under which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the Group.An operating lease is one in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.(j) Inventories and Work in ProgressInventories are stated at the lower of their purchase or production cost and their corresponding net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated re-sale value of the inventories, reduced by the cost of disposal. The cost of inventories is quantified on the basis of the weighted average method and is inclusive of the costs associated with their acquisition or production (in the case of internally produced goods) and the costs incurred in bringing them to their present location and condition.Expenses related to client projects which have been won but not yet contracted are classified as work in progress and included in inventories.(k) Trade ReceivablesTrade receivables are recognised initially at fair value. After initial measurement, trade receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. A provision for doubtful trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.(l) Cash and Cash EquivalentsFor the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and call deposits held with banks.(m) Share CapitalOrdinary Shares are classified as equity.Share premium is shown as an addition to the shareholders’ equity and represents the premium amount paid on the issue of new shares.External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown as a deduction, net of tax, in equity from the proceeds. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable some or all of the facility will be drawn down.(n) BorrowingsBorrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs, are initially recognised at fair value. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
(o) Trade PayablesTrade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value, which is considered to be their fair value. After initial measurement, trade payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.(p) Income TaxesThe tax expense represents the sum of the tax payable for the current period and deferred tax.The tax payable in the current period is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit for the year as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expenditure which are taxable or deductible in other periods. It further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for tax in the current period is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the Income Statement.Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right of offset and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current assets and liabilities on a net basis.(q) Post Retirement BenefitsThe Group’s defined benefit obligation in respect of post-retirement benefits is calculated by estimating the value of benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, based on the level of employee earnings in accordance with Greek Labour Law.The Group has established a provision for staff retirement indemnities based on an actuarial study. The actuarial study is performed every year by an independent qualified firm. There is no requirement for the Group to contribute to any pension plan.(r) Government GrantsGovernment grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.Government grants relating to expenses are recognised in profit or loss in order to match them with the costs they are intended to compensate.67
Notes to the financial statementsGovernment grants in relation to the construction of intangible assets are initially treated as deferred income and recognised as income over the life of the asset by way of a reduced amortisation charge.(s) ProvisionsProvisions are only recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. The expense relating to a provision is recognised in the Income Statement net of any virtually certain reimbursement.(t) Revenue RecognitionRevenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes. The Group assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria to determine whether it is acting as principal or agent.Revenue from sale of third party goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership, together with title to the goods have been transferred to the buyer and the amount can be measured reliably. This occurs on delivery of the goods to the final customer.Revenue from rendering of services is based on the stage of completion determined using the percentage of completion method where revenue is matched with the costs incurred in reaching the stage of completion. The stage of completion is determined by comparing the proportion that costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the budgeted total cost of the services to be performed. The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity. Amounts recoverable on such long term contracts are included in other current assets.The Group combines telecom services with its own software products that are then sold on a “software as a service” basis. This revenue stream includes repeat customer orders for services such as bulk SMS, SMS service integration and web hosting. Revenue from recurring S.a.a.S transactions is recognised on the basis of usage volume at the contracted unit price.Revenues from the provision of WiFi broadband networks is recognised at the date of sale of the non- refundable prepaid access card to the venue owner and is determined as a percentage of the price charged to the end user as the Group believes there are no significant continuing performance obligations.The Group sells its own mobile software products and services to its clients, being Mobile Network Operators (“MNOs”) and resellers. Revenue on contracts for the sale of services is recognised on a monthly basis, based on a fixed service fee per active user (a “revenue share model”). The fixed fee is determined as a percentage of the reference price charged to the end user, agreed between the Group and the MNO or reseller.Revenue from the sale of product licences is recognised when ownership of the licence, and the right to use the licence, is unconditionally transferred to the buyer. This is the point at which the buyer takes on all risks and rewards associated with the licence.Revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a mobile product or service arrangement includes multiple elements such as support and maintenance services. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. Changes to the elements in a mobile product or service arrangement could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. The deferred revenue related to elements that are delivered over time are recognised pro rata over the specified term of the agreement.Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain MPS represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. MPS updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support
(“PCS”) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied post- contract customer support term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.Interest income is recognised on the accruals basis taking into account the effective yield on the asset.(u) Financial InstrumentsFinancial instruments are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provision of the instrument. Financial instruments carried on the balance sheet include cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and borrowings. The particular recognition methods adopted are disclosed in the individual policy statements associated with each item.Financial AssetsClassificationThe Group classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.Recognition and MeasurementLoans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, where material, less impairment. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet. The losses from impairment are recognised in the Income Statement in administrative expenses.Offsetting Financial InstrumentsFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.Impairment of Financial Assets – Assets Carried at Amortised CostThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset, or a group of financial assets, is impaired. A financial asset, or a group of financial assets, is impaired, and impairment losses are incurred, only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”), and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset, or group of financial assets, that can be reliably estimated.Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtor or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal repayments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.For the loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The asset’s carrying amount is reduced, and the loss is recognized in profit or loss.69
Notes to the financial statementsIf, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.Financial liabilitiesThe Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings.BorrowingsAfter initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are, where material, subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest amortisation process.(v) Segment InformationOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-makers, who are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments and making strategic decisions.(w) GoodwillGoodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units).(x) Share-Based PaymentsThe Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 “Share-based payments”. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of options that are expected to vest and recognises the impact of any revision to original estimates in profit or loss with corresponding adjustments to shareholders equity.The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than Directors or employees, profit or loss is charged with the fair value of the goods and services received.(y) Critical Accounting Estimates and JudgementsThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates
on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.There is a critical judgement related to the recognition of revenue for multiple element contracts. Management has to determine the fair value of each deliverable to ensure appropriate recognition and deferral of income.Key Sources of Estimation Uncertaintyi) Estimation of Contract IncomeEstimated income receivable on contracts is judged by Management through the application of their experience and knowledge of the industry in which the Group operates. Income for each individual contract is determined according to the stage of completion determined by reference to the cost of services performed to date as a percentage of the total cost of services to be performed. Management consider that the cost of services performed under each contract at any stage of completion when compared to total budgeted cost is an accurate measure of the work performed under those contracts. Total budgeted costs are continually reviewed throughout the contract for accuracy and costs incurred are closely monitored against budget. As at 31 December 2013, the amount recoverable on long term contracts was €16,197,000 (2012 – €9,029,000).ii) Provision for Bad Debts and Impairment of Financial AssetsManagement carry out detailed reviews of trade and other receivables during the financial year. This review takes into account the age of the debt, credit history and information available about the financial strength of the client or counterparty. If it is considered, based on the available evidence, more likely than not that the debt will not be recovered in full then a provision is made to write down the receivable to reflect the anticipated recovery. Details of the provision against doubtful debts are set out in note 23.iii) Impairment of GoodwillDetermining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and apply a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. These cash flows could be affected upwards or downwards by movements in several factors to include market conditions and operating costs. The calculation is also sensitive to changes in discount rate. Details of the impairment review are set out in note 18.iv) Deferred TaxationThe Group is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions. Judgement is required in determining the provision for such taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will affect the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of carrying forward tax losses and tax credits arising from the Group’s tax credit claim related to research and development expenditure. In accordance with Greek Tax Law, fifty per cent of eligible expenditure on scientific and technological research can be claimed from the General Secretariat for Research and Technology and, if accepted, deducted from Greek GAAP taxable profits. If the tax credit claim in any one year exceeds the Greek GAAP tax liability, the tax credit can be carried forward as tax losses and offset against future tax liabilities for a maximum period of five years. Any excess is not refunded in cash. Should the claims submitted to the General Secretariat not be accepted in whole or in part71
Notes to the financial statementsor if insufficient future Greek taxable profits are generated within the required timescale, the Group may need to revise the carrying value of this asset.3. Financial Risk ManagementThe Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group’s overall risk management focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on its financial performance.Foreign Exchange RiskThe Group operates internationally and is currently exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from various currency exposures with respect to certain customers’ and suppliers’ balances, primarily with regard to US dollars, the UK pound and UAE Dirhams. The Group also has investments in foreign operations. At 31 December 2013, if US dollars had weakened/strengthened by 10% against the Euro with all other variables held constant, post tax profit for the year would have been € 343,000 higher/lower as a result of gains/losses on translation of US Dollars assets and liabilities. The Group does not enter into derivative or hedging transactions to manage its foreign exchange risk.Interest Rate RiskThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows and places surplus cash at floating interest rates. Exposure to interest rate risk on borrowings and cash investments is monitored on an ongoing and proactive basis. All borrowings are denominated in Euros. During the year ended 31 December 2013, if average interest rates on borrowings had been 200 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, pre-tax profit for the year would have been € 242,000 lower/higher as a result of higher/lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.Credit RiskThe principal risk facing the Group is with the ability of the counterparties to honour their commitments to the Group, together with the concentration of this risk with a limited number of trading partners.Credit risk arises from work in progress, trade receivables, post-dated cheques received, advance payments to subcontractors and suppliers, and amounts recoverable on long term contracts. With regard to the international mobile applications market, the Group currently has a concentration of risk with a small number of mobile network operators and resellers. The Group seeks to mitigate these risks wherever possible by assessing the credit quality of the customer which, in the absence of any independent rating, takes into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Long term and ongoing relationships with customers also reduce the credit risk.Liquidity RiskCash plan budgets and forecasts are prepared and monitored at an individual entity and Group level in order to control liquidity requirements and ensure sufficient cash resources exist in order to meet operational needs. In addition, cash forecasts are used to ensure the Group adheres to the terms of its borrowing facilities and loan covenants, where applicable. Any surplus cash is held in interest bearing bank accounts.The Group’s financing requirements have significantly increased due to investment in software development and other working capital requirements. The Group partly meets its financing needs through revolving credit and term loan facilities established with banks which are secured over the Group’s assets.Fair Value EstimationManagement consider that the carrying amount of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
4. Segment InformationThe following segments are based on the management reports received by the executive directors (who are the chief operating decision makers) which are used to make strategic decisions. The executive directors consider the business based on a grouping of product offerings by medium of delivery. The main segments are:Mobile products and services: The main activity of the Group. The Group sells its own mobile software products and services to its clients.Telecom services (S.a.a.S): The Group combines telecom services with its own software products (e-business and WiFi services) that are then sold on a “software as a service” basis.Third party goods: The Group resells third party goods, to its customers, mainly comprising mobile accessories.The Directors assess the performance of the operating segments based on revenue from external customers and gross profit. The segment information provided to the Directors for the reportable segments for the year ended 31 December 2013 is as follows:Total assets581 22,190 108,618 131,389 –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––Telecom Third party services- goods S.a.a.S w’000 w’0001,892 4,953 (1,701) –– (354)Mobile products and services w’00064,669 –(20,965)Total w’00071,514 (1,701) (21,319) (8,253)Revenue from external customers Inventory costsOther expensesAmortisationGross Profit––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– Depreciation – 268 114 382– (899) –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––Total liabilities 1,998 6,077 10,280 18,355 –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––A further analysis of the Group’s revenue for the year 2013 is shown below:Revenue 2013 (w’000) Consumer mobility servicesEnterprise mobility licenses and subscriptions Mobile software projectsThird party goodsWi-Fi Broadband servicesSoftware as a ServiceTotal––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– Revenues from third party goods comprise the sale of mobile accessories.–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––(7,354)Expenditure on tangible fixed assets Expenditure on intangible fixed assets– 184 1,404 1,588– 801 13,776 14,577191 3,700 36,350 40,241Telecom Third party services goods (S.a.a.S)– – – – – –1,892 – – 434 – 4,519Mobile products and services34,808 14,903 14,958– – –Total34,808 14,903 14,9581,892 434 4,5191,892 4,953 64,669 71,51473

The standard rate of tax in Greece changed from 20% to 26% with effect from 1 January 2013.Tax losses available to be carried forward by the parent Company and the UK branch of Globo International LLC at 31 December 2013 against future profits are estimated to comprise trading losses of approximately €2,417,000 (2012: €140,000) arising in the UK and €4,682,000 (2012: €2,908,000) arising in Greece. A deferred tax asset amounting to approximately €508,000 (31 December 2012: €32,000) has not been recognised in respect of the Company’s accumulated UK losses and approximately €1,217,000 (2012: €582,000) in respect of the Company’s accumulated losses in Greece, as there is insufficient evidence that the asset will be recovered in the foreseeable future. There were no other factors that may affect future tax charges.The Group has utilised tax relief incentives provided by the Cypriot tax jurisdictions. These incentives allow for special treatment on intellectual property and investments made by eligible companies.The Cypriot Tax Law provides for an “Intellectual Property Rights” the following provisions;• The cost for the acquisition or development of the intangible assets (being of a capital nature) is amortised equally over a five years period. This is applicable for every person carrying on a business for the acquisition or development of intangible assets as defined in the Patent Law, in the Intellectual Property Right Law and in the Trademark Law. These Laws cover trademarks, patents and IP rights (scientific work, literary work, musical work, artistic work, movies, databases, recordings, broadcasts and publications).• 80% of the profit arising from the use of the intangible assets (including compensation for improper use of such assets) as well as profit on their sale is deemed as an expense in determining the taxable income.• The 80% deduction applies on the profit after deducting all direct expenses such as amortisation of the assets, interest expense to finance the acquisition or development of the assets, as well as any other direct expenses.a) Untaxed Reserves“Untaxed reserves” are used to reduce the Group’s taxable profit according to the relevant investment percentage. This percentage is calculated on realised investments and usually varies from 50% to 60%. The result of this calculation is the untaxed reserve, which is deducted from the taxable profit and is not subject to tax. This reserve is for re-investment into the business. If the untaxed reserve is distributed to shareholders, the tax becomes payable. Otherwise it remains indefinitely as a special reserve. The Group has utilised three development Greek laws, L. 1828/1989, L. 2601/1998 and L. 3220/2004.b) Non-Taxable DiscountsThe Group has implemented Greek Law 3296/2004 (ex. L. 2992/2002), to reduce its tax obligations by 50% for expenses related to research and development for software products. No tax credit (2012: Nil) has been recognised in respect of the Group’s tax credit claim for research and development expenditure. In accordance with Greek Tax Law, fifty per cent of eligible expenditure on scientific and technological research (such expenditure being capitalised within intangible fixed assets) is eligible as a deduction from Greek GAAP taxable profits for a maximum period of five years.83

18. GoodwillThe Group has recorded goodwill as the result of multiple business combinations. The goodwill is related to different cash generating units (CGU) and the amount of goodwill recorded by CGU is not considered material individually or in the aggregate. On a yearly basis management performs an impairment analysis to determine if the recorded value is fairly stated using a value in use calculation. Management uses a weighted average cost of capital based on the debt and equity of the group which was calculated to be approximately 13%. Management uses growth rates within the forecast period that range from 5-15% after which it uses a perpetual growth rate of approximately 0.7%. It was determined that no impairment was necessary for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012.19. Business Combinations - Acquisition in 2013Acquisition of Notify TechnologyDuring 2013 Globo acquired the business and net assets of Notify Technology Inc. (“Notify”), a mobile technology company specialising in wireless mobility solutions and services, for a cash consideration of US$5.3 million (€3.9 million). The acquisition agreement was signed on 3 October 2013 with a completion date of 17 October 2013 through a newly established company in the USA, under the name of Globo Mobile Technologies Inc (US), fully owned subsidiary company (100%) within the Globo GroupThis acquisition added approximately 60 new employees to our US subsidiary.Notify enables organisations to define, simplify and implement their mobility strategies, including the management of mobile devices. Founded in 1994, Notify is located in San Jose, California, where all sales, marketing and finance personnel are located. Notify’s product development and technical support centre is located in Canfield, Ohio. Notify offers businesses mobility solutions, enterprise mobility management, data loss prevention, and BlackBerry device management for the Bring Your Own Device (“BYOD”) market. Its products provide the management, control and oversight needed to maintain a secure and productive mobile environment for businesses of any size, and have been recognised by Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Wireless Email for the past six years.Notify has been successfully integrated post-acquisition into the Group. Under Globo's ownership, Notify has both retained and built on customer relationships including Novell and Oracle, and all its reselling partners. The MDM functionality represents an important competitive addition to the Group’s mobile enterprise offering. Based on this platform the Group has initiated a recruitment procedure with a focus on ramping up our sales and technical presence in the US.89

The “ordinary reserve” can be distributed only upon the dissolution of the Greek companies but can be utilised to offset accumulated losses.The “untaxed reserves” have been created in the periods from 2002 onwards, as a result of tax legislation. This permits the indefinite deferral of tax on otherwise taxable profits, as a form of an investment incentive, on the condition that the said profits are reinvested into the business. Tax deferred in this way is crystallised on the disposal of the assets acquired, within a period of 5 years from their acquisition, or whenever the untaxed reserves are distributed. The tax liability that will crystallise on the distribution of these reserves, estimated, as at 31 December 2013 is €633,000 (31 December 2012 – €633,000) and shall be recognised as and when a decision to distribute these reserves, in full or in part, is taken.The “financial means reserve” has been created as a result of the loss from selling the shares of subsidiary company 3nSold S.A. at a lower value than that at which it was acquired. This reserve will remain for an indefinite period until the loss is recovered by profits from selling shares or at the dissolution of the Greek companies (at which time it will be offset with any “ordinary reserve” in existence at the time).Net “other reserves” comprise the excess paid to acquire a non-controlling interest of (€564,000) and undistributed post-tax profits of €483,000. Changes in ownership interests after control is obtained, and do not result in a change of control, are accounted for as equity transactions with any excess paid recognised within other reserves attributable to equity holders rather than additional goodwill. The undistributed post- tax profits can be used to increase the share capital of Greek companies, or can be distributed to the shareholders at any time, without any tax obligation. The use of this reserve is subject to the decision of a general meeting.The “merger reserve” arises on consolidation as a result of merger accounting for the historic acquisition of Globo Technologies S.A., and represents the difference between the value of the share capital and premium issued for the acquisition and that of the acquired equity of Globo Technologies S.A.–(259)(259)101

Retirement Benefit ObligationsThe subsidiaries are required, under Greek Law, to make a payment to employees upon unfair dismissal or upon attaining normal retirement age. The amount payable depends on the employees’ monthly earnings and a multiple which depends on the length of service.The payment on unfair dismissal or upon attaining normal retirement age is based on the following table:Employment timeFrom one year up to four yearsFrom four years up to six years From six years up to eight years From eight years up to ten years From ten years onwardsRetirement benefit in monthly wages2345(number of years: minus 4)up to top limit of 12 monthly wagesIn order to define the Group’s retirement benefit obligation to its employees an actuarial study was carried out for the year 2013 and the following assumptions were used to perform the calculations:(a) Mortality based upon the Greek actuarial company (E.A.E) figures as at 1990.(b) Interest cost was set at 4%.(c) Current service cost based on standard wages.(d) Age of retirement as set by the Social Security Insurance Institution (IKA).(e) No unfair dismissal before retirement would occur.(f) Yearly increases in wages of 2.0%.The latest actuarial study is dated 17 January 2014.

The Group manages its capital structure according to economic conditions and makes adjustments to it in light of changes to those conditions. Furthermore the Group is continuously reviewing its working and investment capital needs in order to secure cash flows and financing facilities to support them. The Group is using short term debt, long term debt and equity to finance its product development and infrastructure needs. In situations where new capital requirements are imposed by new projects that the Group is aiming to engage, careful planning is undertaken to ensure optimum spending within the project’s resources and within existing and/or new financing facilities.40.

You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to a single share. To appoint more than one proxy, please contact the registrars of the Company, Share Registrars Limited on 44 (0) 1252 821390.5. If you do not give your proxy an indication of how to vote on any resolution, they will vote or abstain from voting at their discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as they think fit on any other matter which is put before the meeting. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution.6. The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your proxy how to vote on each resolution or withhold their vote.7. To appoint a proxy using the proxy form, the form must be completed and signed. It must then be sent or delivered to the Company’s registrars, Share Registrars Limited, Suite E, 1st floor, 9 Lion and Lamb Yard, Farnham, Surrey GU9 7LL. Alternatively it can be sent by fax to 44 (0) 1252 719232; or scanned and sent by email to proxies@shareregistrars.uk.com. The proxy form must be received by Share Registrars Limited no later than 10.00 a.m. on Tuesday 17 June 2014.8. In the case of a member which is a company, the proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney or other authority under which the proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be submitted with the proxy form.Appointment of proxy by joint members9. In the case of joint shareholders, where more than one of them purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).Changing proxy instructions10. To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Note that the cut-off time for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in relation to amended instructions; any amended proxy appointment received after the relevant cut-off time will
be disregarded. Where you have appointed a proxy using a hard-copy proxy form and would like to change the instructions using another hard-copy proxy form, please contact Share Registrars Limited on 44 (0) 1252 821390.If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the one received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will have effect.Termination of proxy appointments11. In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company by sending a signed hard copy notice clearly stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment, to: Share Registrars Limited, Suite E, 1st floor, 9 Lion and Lamb Yard, Farnham, Surrey GU9 7LL or by fax to 44 (0) 1252 719232. In the case of a member which is a company, the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be submitted with the revocation notice. In either case, the revocation notice must be received by Share Registrars Limited no later than 10.00 a.m. on Tuesday 17 June 2014.If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received after the time specified then, subject to the paragraph directly below, your proxy appointment will remain valid.Appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the meeting and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.Communication12. Except as provided above, members who have general queries about the meeting should contact Share Registrars Limited on 44 (0) 1252 821390 or by email to enquiries@shareregistrars.uk.com (no other methods of communication will be accepted).You may not use any electronic address provided either:• in this notice of annual general meeting; or• any related documents (including the proxy form),to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.Issued shares and total voting rights13. As at 5.00 p.m. on the day immediately prior to the date of posting of this notice of meeting, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 373,689,061 ordinary shares of 1p each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company at that time was 373,689,061.117
Annual General Meeting – Explanation of BusinessThis year’s annual general meeting will be held at 10.00 a.m. on Thursday 19 June 2014 at 55 Old Broad Street, London EC2M 1RX. The notice of meeting is set out on pages 114 and 115 of this document and a form of proxy is enclosed.Details of resolutions to be considered at the meeting are given below.Accounts (resolution 1)In accordance with usual practice, shareholders are asked to receive the report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013.Directors (resolutions 2 and 3)Under the Company’s articles of association, Costis Papadimitrakopoulos and Dr Joseph Coughlin are due to retire by rotation and they each offer themselves for re-election by shareholders. Biographical details of all of the directors are given on pages 38 and 39 of this document.Auditors (resolution 4)Company law requires shareholders to reappoint the auditors each year. During the year the audit was put out to tender and the Board appointed Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditors of the Company. A resolution to appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP is therefore being put to shareholders at the AGM. Special notice has been received of the intention to propose this resolution. The Board recommends the external auditors’ appointment. The resolution also authorises the directors to determine the auditors’ remuneration in accordance with normal practice.Authority to allot shares (resolutions 5 and 6)In accordance with current guidelines, the Directors seek authority to allot up to a maximum of 124,563,000 relevant securities. This represents approximately 33% of the issued ordinary share capital as at 23 May 2014. Further, in order to retain some flexibility, the Directors seek power to allot 37,368,906 equity securities wholly for cash other than on a pre-emptive basis to current shareholders pro-rata to their existing holdings. This amount represents 10% of the issued ordinary share capital as at 23 May 2014. These authorities will continue in force until the annual general meeting to be held in 2015 or 30 June 2015, whichever is the earlier.Authority for the Company to purchase its own shares (resolution 7)Resolution 7 authorises the Company, until the earlier of next year’s AGM or 30 June 2015, to purchase in the market up to a maximum of 56,053,359 ordinary shares (equivalent to 15% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 23 May 2014) for cancellation at a minimum price of 1p per share and a maximum price per share of an amount equal to 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for an ordinary share (as derived from the Daily Official List) for the five business days immediately before the date of purchase.The Companies Act 2006 allows the Company to hold any repurchased shares in treasury, instead of cancelling them immediately. If the Company buys back its own shares and holds them in treasury it may then deal with some or all of them in several ways. It may sell them for cash; transfer them under the provisions of an employee share scheme; cancel them; or continue to hold them in treasury. Holding shares in treasury in this way would allow the Company to reissue them quickly and cost effectively, giving increased flexibility to the management of its capital base. Dividends are not paid on shares held in treasury, nor do they carry voting rights while they remain there. The Directors intend to decide at the time of any share buyback, whether to cancel the shares immediately or to hold them in treasury, depending on the interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole, at the time. The Company does not currently hold any shares in treasury. This proposal should not be taken as an indication that the Company will purchase shares at any particular price or indeed at all, and the Directors will only consider making purchases if they believe that such purchases would result in an increase in earnings per share and are in the best interests of shareholders.It is intended to renew each of the above authorities at each annual general meeting.
